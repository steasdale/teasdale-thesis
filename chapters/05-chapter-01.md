# Chapter 1 Slavery and social networks: a new look at the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean

In an American Historical Review forum titled “looking at slavery from broader perspectives,” renowned historian David Brion Davis expressed concern that, in the historiography of early Atlantic slavery, scant attention had been paid “to the Italian merchants and bankers who provided the capital, technology, and sailors that enabled the Portuguese to establish an African… commercial empire.”[[1\]](#_ftn1) This study represents a partial response to Davis. It will reconstruct the socioeconomic networks instantiated during the late medieval Mediterranean slaving enterprise. These networks emerged from the interactions between merchants and the enslaved from various Mediterranean locales during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The subsequent expansion of these socioeconomic networks along the coast of western Africa during the fifteenth and early sixteenth century were crucial in shaping the early Atlantic slaving enterprise. This study will focus on the social and commercial networks developed and refined by the activities of Genoese merchant families in the late medieval market economy of slavery from 1348 to 1528.

The period between the Black Death of 1348–50 and the emergence of the aristocratic constitutional revolution of Andrea Doria in 1528 has often been framed as a sort of Genoese “dark age”, one from which the city would triumphantly rise into the “golden age” of the late sixteenth century described by Fernand Braudel.[[2\]](#_ftn2) Yet it was the financial, social, and intellectual capital accumulated by Genoese merchants through their vigorous participation in the late medieval market economy of slavery that allowed them to become one of the primary financiers of the early sixteenth-century Spanish and Portuguese expansion into the Atlantic world. This thesis thus represents a contribution to two important historiographical traditions. It contributes to the history of Mediterranean slavery through an alternate framework that elucidates the socioeconomic networks that structured the market economy of slavery in the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean. The phenomenon of slaveholding and the exchange of enslaved persons will be shown as the central activity that underpinned the expansion and consolidation of these networks. This thesis will contribute to the history of Genoa during the period from 1348 to 1528 by examining its socioeconomic world through the lens of slavery. It will illustrate how the participants in this world—both the slaveholders and the enslaved—defined the contours of the late medieval market economy of slavery. The accumulation of social and economic capital by slaveholders will be shown as the crucial foundational component for the Genoese ‘golden age’ of the sixteenth century.

This study proposes the analysis of late medieval Mediterranean slavery from the perspective of Genoa and the socioeconomic networks of Genoese merchants. The republic of Genoa has long been recognized as a major participant in the Mediterranean slaving enterprise and Genoese merchants administered the commercial colonies that supplied enslaved persons to the entire Mediterranean region.[[3\]](#_ftn3) The reconstruction of their socioeconomic networks will illustrate how these merchants accumulated financial, social, political, and spiritual capital through the exchange of enslaved men and women. The enslaved were also an important part of these socioeconomic networks and a close reading of contracts related to their exchange will offer brief glimpses into their often-hidden experiences. It must always be kept in mind that Mediterranean slavery was a multifaceted and complex enterprise, with many important commercial centres—including Venice, the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, and Iberia as well as Genoa—each with their own socioeconomic networks that overlapped and frequently intersected with each other. This study proposes that similar narratives could—and should—be told from Iberian, Ottoman, and African perspectives. Similar network-based approaches applied to these regions and their historical actors would contribute to a more complete and more entangled view of Mediterranean slavery. This study therefore makes no claim to geographic, cultural, or social comprehensiveness: it is a study of the market economy of slavery in the late medieval Mediterranean based on the development and evolution of the social and commercial networks of Genoese merchants, slaveholders, and the enslaved.

## 1.1 The historiography of late medieval and early modern Mediterranean slavery

The reformer Andreas Karlstadt, following the footsteps of an earlier voyage made by Martin Luther, traveled to Rome in the spring of 1516 to study at *La Sapienza.* He described the presence of a market where “people could sell one another… just like someone who sells an ox allows the buyer to possess the body.”[[4\]](#_ftn4) Karlstadt was shocked by this phenomenon and invoked scripture to condemn an institution he saw as immoral and indicative of a dangerous chasm between proper Christian behavior and ecclesiastical governance.[[5\]](#_ftn5) His observation, despite his misgivings, illustrated the commonplace nature of slavery in late medieval Europe. It also suggested that the presence of a slave market mere steps from the sacred centre of the Christian Catholicism furnished the practice with an implicit ecclesiastical legitimacy. The traffic in human souls witnessed by Karlstadt occurred at the temporal crux of an important socioeconomic transformation: the first decades of the sixteenth century when Mediterranean networks of enslavement were expanding into the Atlantic world. The institution of slavery would no longer seem strange, anachronistic, or immoral to early modern Europeans within a few decades: the rapid colonial expansion into the Americas would be coupled with the rapid expansion of the slaving enterprise to an order of magnitude not seen since the age of classical Rome.

The reportage of Karlstadt reveals the long and sustained existence of slavery in the Mediterranean region throughout the Middle Ages. March Bloch and other French historians of the early twentieth century had argued that slavery had largely disappeared from late medieval Europe. But their studies had overlooked the vigorous commerce of enslaved persons in the ports of the Mediterranean, particularly in the cities of the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas.[[6\]](#_ftn6) Slavery remained alive and well in major European cities during the entirety of the Middle Ages, as research conducted over the past several decades and has unequivocally confirmed.[[7\]](#_ftn7)

The seminal articles and books of Charles Verlinden transformed the study of medieval and early modern slavery from a curiosity in the dusty corners of legal history to a major field of study within Mediterranean socioeconomic history. His two volume *L’esclavage dans l’Europe Médiévale* explored Mediterranean slavery in Iberia, France, Italy, and the Byzantine empire from the tenth to the sixteenth century.[[8\]](#_ftn8) He compiled and synthesized large sets of demographic data that described the commerce in enslaved persons, identified the national origins of enslaved populations, examined the legal status and social condition of enslaved persons, and outlined the movement and spatiotemporal distribution of the enslaved across the Mediterranean. Verlinden demarcated his analysis on individual locales but the results implicitly suggested that the parts were reflective of the whole: the Mediterranean slaving enterprise had a common structure that crossed jurisdictional and regional boundaries.

The late nineteenth century historian Marcello Staglieno had transcribed a previously unidentified collection of sources from the Genoese state archives with the intention of publishing a history of Genoese slavery.[[9\]](#_ftn9) This study was never undertaken but his transcriptions were published and analyzed by Luigi Tria in *La schiavitù in Liguria*.[[10\]](#_ftn10) Tria focused on the linguistic structure of these sources: isolating various Latin phrases and tracing their provenance in classical Roman law and in medieval Genoese statutory law. The focus was primarily the language of sales contracts, and to a lesser degree the language of manumission contracts, enacted between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries. The linguistic focus employed by Tria revealed many legal aspects of the Genoese slaving enterprise but ultimately suffered from the lack of historical contextualization. The contextualization eschewed by Tria was adopted a few decades later by Domenico Gioffrè in his *Il mercato degli schiavi a Genova nel secolo XV*.[[11\]](#_ftn11) His socioeconomic approach to Genoese slavery explored the movement and supply of enslaved persons in the city with a strong focus on economic valuation. The study compiled wealth of quantitative data on the population, origins, and prices of enslaved persons of in Genoa from the earlier studies of Tria and Rodolfo Livi and from an ample collection of previously unidentified notarial contracts. The intense focus on quantitative analysis illustrated the commerce of the enslaved was not an isolated niche of economic activity but represented a considerable source of financial capital for the Genoese merchants. The unintended result of this quantitative approach was an aversion away from any detailed consideration of the social character and social networks of the enslaved and the slaveholders.

The robust and substantive research on late medieval Iberian slavery in the decades after Verlinden was not matched by commensurate body of work for the Italian region.[[12\]](#_ftn12) The study of medieval Mediterranean slavery by Jacques Heers had a large Genoese component and provided some useful social contextualization and comparative analysis for the work of Gioffrè. His *Esclaves et domestiques au Moyen Âge dans le monde méditerranéen* outlined the social landscape of enslavement through an examination of social relations, forms of enslavement, and the interaction of enslavement and religion through the activities of ransom and captivity conducted by Christian and Muslim corsairs.[[13\]](#_ftn13) The study provided an excellent overview of the Mediterranean slaving enterprise but lacked the regional emphasis to elucidate the specific Genoese situation—or any other particular situation—in any detail. The recent publication *Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Eastern Mediterranean* collected a series of essays on Mediterranean slavery from interdisciplinary perspectives that considered Mediterranean slavery from the intersecting perspectives of European and Muslim merchants.[[14\]](#_ftn14) This approach was also adopted by Hannah Barker in her recent study *That Most Precious Merchandise: The Mediterranean Trade in Black Sea Slaves,* which explored the common sociocultural practices that underpinned Mamluk, Genoese, and Venetian slavery in the Black Sea region.[[15\]](#_ftn15) Barker provided new and important insights into late medieval Genoese slavery: she made new inroads into the demography and exploitation of enslaved persons in the Genoese colonies and outlined the shared characteristics of the economies of slavery in Genoa, Venice, and the Mamluk Empire.

## 1.2 The historiography of Genoa and the Genoese, 1348–1528

The poet Dante had the following to say about Genoa in the thirty-third canto of the *Inferno*:

> O all you Genovese, you men estranged
> from every good, at home with every vice,
> why can't the world be wiped clean of your race? (Inferno 33, 151–153)[[16\]](#_ftn16)

The summary judgment on the Genoese character seems to have cursed subsequent centuries of English historical scholarship on late medieval Genoa. The stereotype of the Genoese as estranged from virtue and at home with vice was soon picked up by Giovanni Boccaccio. The Genoese characters in his tales from the *Decameron* were primarily driven by greed, avarice, lawlessness, and lust.[[17\]](#_ftn17) Francesco Petrarca similarly characterized the body politic of Genoa as a medical patient who had the appearance of a healthy body but was infected with internal diseases of vice and civil discord.[[18\]](#_ftn18) The fifteenth century historian Biondo Flavio suggested that Genoa was “luckier in her business affairs than in cultural pursuits” and emphasized that its commercial success came at a cost to its cultural life.[[19\]](#_ftn19) The early sixteenth-century historians Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini portrayed Genoa as a city stricken by civil discord, an unstable and dangerous metropolis where competing factions were all too willing to welcome foreign tyrants in attempts to restrain each other.[[20\]](#_ftn20) The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt synthesized these negative impressions in his *Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy*, stating that “Genoa scarcely comes within the range of our task, as before the time of Andrea Doria it took almost no part in the Renaissance [and] was proverbial among Italians for its contempt of all higher culture,” thus unequivocally excluding Genoa from his vision of Renaissance Italian cultural efflorescence.[[21\]](#_ftn21) The historical marginalization of the city in late medieval historiography continued unabated into the twentieth century. In most English-language historical surveys, late medieval Genoa, if mentioned at all, was usually presented as the paradigm of republicanism gone wrong, an exemplar of civic instability engendered by factionalism and often framed as the counterpoint to the ‘most serene’ Venetian republic. The historian Hans Baron briefly mentioned Genoa in his study of civic humanism, but only in relation to its political alliance with Venice and Florence against Milan.[[22\]](#_ftn22) The city has also been ignored by the intellectual historians of the Cambridge school and its adherents, despite its unique and relatively inclusive version of republicanism, in favour of an implicit Florentine exceptionalism.[[23\]](#_ftn23) The central role of Genoa as a staging ground for the Crusades and as a prominent geospatial locus for the late medieval slave trade might have played an unconscious role in this historical omission: perhaps it seemed antithetical to include the centre of such past events as an active participant in the cultural and intellectual efflorescence that characterized the Italian Renaissance. The persistence of the historiographical notion that European slavery died out in the Middle Ages may have also played a part in the omission of Genoa from English language surveys, as any significant engagement with its political and cultural world would have had to consider its vital role of the Mediterranean slave trade.

The temporal frame of recent historiography on the economy of premodern Genoa has been shaped by the strong attraction of two earlier influential historical arguments: those of Roberto Lopez and Fernand Braudel. Lopez situated the city as the pre-eminent centre of thirteenth and early fourteenth-century Mediterranean trade in his *Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages* and identified its merchants as important innovators of commercial and administrative institutions.[[24\]](#_ftn24) Fernand Braudel likewise situated the city as the preeminent centre of early modern Mediterranean finance in his *Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II*, positing an “age of the Genoese” between 1557 and 1640 where its nascent capitalists provided the financial capital and expertise that fueled Spanish expansion into the Atlantic world.[[25\]](#_ftn25) Subsequent works have followed in the temporal paths of these two foundational studies. The studies of Benjamin Kedar, Michel Balard, Sandra Origone, Steven Epstein, and Quentin van Doosselaere have followed the path laid down by Lopez by focusing on the era of the so-called “commercial revolution” and on the role of commerce and commercial instruments in economic history in Genoese history prior to 1348.[[26\]](#_ftn26) The works of Thomas Alison Kirk, Faruk Tabak, Céline Dauverd, and Mauricio Drelichman and Hans-Joachim Voth have followed the path laid down by Braudel by focusing on the so-called “golden age of Genoa” and on the links between Genoese financiers and the Spanish Crown from the middle sixteenth century.[[27\]](#_ftn27)

The strong intellectual attraction of these two historiographical summits and the works that followed them has resulted in the unintentional demarcation of the late fourteenth and entire fifteenth century as a kind of Genoese ‘dark age.’ In the era when Florence and Venice were entering their periods of high Renaissance culture characterized by charismatic and learned political figures, public works of art and architecture, extensive commercial and financial networks, and vigorous revival of Roman cultural ideals, much English language scholarship has characterized fifteenth-century Genoa as an “inconvenient relic” of thirteenth-century popular republicanism, rife with innate factionalism and all too willing to submit to the yoke of foreign intervention.[[28\]](#_ftn28) This borderline essentialist characterization has been forwarded by some otherwise careful scholars. Peter Burke, for example, justified his omission of Genoa in his analysis of early modern cultural history by asserting that he could catalogue only six “worthy” Ligurian intellectuals, five of whom were from the sixteenth century, thus implicitly reinforcing the notion of an intellectual Genoese ‘dark age’ between 1348 and 1528.[[29\]](#_ftn29) 

This study will not only contribute to an understudied period of Genoese history, at least in the English scholarship, it will also provide an important corrective to the notion that the Genoese fifteenth century was a lachrymose middle period characterized by political infighting, cultural stasis, and economic stagnation. The Genoese commercial world remained dynamic and innovative throughout this period, and the recognition by fourteenth and fifteenth Genoese merchants of the lucrative nature of the market economy of slavery provided the necessary economic foundation for the later emergence of the republic as a major financial centre.

## 1.3 Analytical categories and terminology

This study makes use of some novel analytical categories and terminology. These categories and terms are simply heuristics meant to facilitate the analysis and understanding of the commercial history of the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean. They have no essential historical quality in themselves.

### The life-cycle of slavery

The term ‘life cycle of slavery’ is used throughout this study to indicate the period in which an enslaved person was legally classified as enslaved and not free. This life cycle, like all life cycles, was characterized by a birth and a death punctuated in-between by significant life events. The life cycle of slavery began at the point when a person was taken into slavery and ended with their manumission. It could represent part of a life or an entire life. The son of an enslaved woman in the Genoese Mediterranean was born enslaved, having inherited the characteristic from his mother. If he died without ever being liberated then the life cycle of slavery in his case was his entire life. The life cycle of slavery was punctuated by events or ruptures corresponding to the market instruments that could fundamentally alter this life cycle. The historian of antebellum slavery Walter Johnson asked if “a slave sale [was] an untimely rupture of the generally benign character of the relation between master and slave or hard evidence of the hidden structure of that relation, [or] a part of slavery that revealed the malign character of the whole?”[[30\]](#_ftn30) This study suggests that it could be all these things, and that the market instruments that effected the exchange of enslaved persons could rupture stable relationships—for example, separating an enslaved woman from her child—and when examined in the aggregate only further underscores the malign character of the entire enterprise.

### The market economy of slavery

The term ‘market economy of slavery’ used in this study is a heuristic that refers to various forms of capital exchange relating to slavery and the enslaved. The economist Alex Marshall has defined the market economy, as used in modern discourse, as a legal construction.[[31\]](#_ftn31) It does not only refer to monetary or financial transactions: it also refers to the exchange of social, and intellectual capital among merchants embedded within social and economic networks. This heuristic can also be understood as a type of ‘instituted process’ described by Karl Polanyi in its emphasis on the interaction between economic actors and their environment and the consideration of non-financial forms of capital exchange.[[32\]](#_ftn32)

## 1.4 Creating a database of Genoese merchants

This study is founded upon the close, contextual, and aggregate analysis of a dataset of over two thousand notarial contracts enacted in Genoa between 1348 and 1528. In the summer of 2015 the Genoese archivist and historian Giustina Olgiati identified several notaries as dominant in the economies of slavery within the city of Genoa.[[33\]](#_ftn33) Three of these notaries were selected to provide a broad temporal scope and sufficient material for a robust analysis: Giuliano Canella (active 1370–1420), Bartolomeo de Facio (active 1426–1465), and Tommaso Duracino (active 1452–1498). The bulk of the contracts used in this study were enacted by these three men. The published and unpublished finding aids of various archivists and historians also proved crucial to this endeavor by identifying additional fonds that might be rich in contracts related to enslavement in the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean. These included several nineteenth-century registers in the Genoese archives compiled by Alessandro Wolf and Marcello Staglieno that listed—and sometimes transcribed—contracts related to slavery in the fifteenth century, as well as the summaries provided by the more recent studies of Luigi Tria and Domenico Gioffrè.[[34\]](#_ftn34) The analysis of these aids allowed for the identification of several hundred additional contracts to supplement the those enacted by the notaries above, which allowed for a greater density and broader time span for the dataset.

The close and contextual reading of these contracts provided the material to create a database of slaveholders and the enslaved in the late medieval and early modern Mediterranean. The following methodology was used to create the structured dataset underpinning this database:

1. A dataset of over two thousand contracts related to the economies of slavery was created and the contents of the contracts were analyzed and summarized in a rigorous manner as indicated in the following steps.[[35\]](#_ftn35) The relevant contracts of Canella, Fazio, and Duracino were digitized, along with a selection of contracts enacted by other notaries. The contracts selected for digitization ensured a consistent sample of material across the timespan of the study.
2. The digitized contracts were organized into a structured digital archive using the Tropy Archival Management software.
3. Bibliographic descriptions were created for each contract and entered into the Zotero reference management system.[[36\]](#_ftn36)
4. The contracts were identified by types—sales contracts, manumissions, leases, insurance contracts, testaments, and procurations—and the names of the principal transactors of each contract (that is, the two contracting parties) were recorded, along with the names of enslaved persons named in these contracts, as well as the names of any additional participants.
5. The close, careful, and painstaking analysis of these names allowed for the further identification of the residency, age, regional provenance, ancestry, occupation, and social category for almost all the named slaveholders.[[37\]](#_ftn37)
6. Additional social, economic, geographic, and legal information was extracted from the contracts, such as place of enaction, the price of sale, and other essential information types.
7. The data were imported and encoded into an RDF database with a novel ontology expressly developed for this purpose. This ontology, named GEMENET, is an extension of the CIDOC-CRM 7.1.1 conceptual framework. The encoded data was based upon classes defined in this ontology, which included classes that represented persons, place, and object (contract) types.[[38\]](#_ftn38)

The sample size of 2166 contracts is large enough to be representative for the period, but it must be noted this is a mere fraction of the total. There are undoubtedly many more contracts sitting in the notarial archive that have yet to be identified. The archive itself is also incomplete: many contracts were never deposited after the death of a notary, were improperly archived upon deposit, or were damaged or lost over the subsequent centuries. The bombardment of Genoa by Louis XIV in 1684, during which the edifice housing the notarial college was directly struck, also destroyed a significant proportion of the notarial archive.[[39\]](#_ftn39) The underground economy, moreover, was particularly strong in regards to slavery in the premodern Mediterranean and Atlantic worlds, so what might seem like a considerable archival resource only records a mere sliver of the total economy of slavery. The convergence of these factors led the Atlantic historian Toby Green to rightly suggest that the size and scope of the premodern slave trade has been greatly underestimated.[[40\]](#_ftn40) This study is in firm agreement with his assertion.

The database was constructed in parallel with this study and is intended to be a companion for the reader. The notarial contracts referenced in the study and their constituent transactors can be viewed online at http://www.genoesemerchantnetworks.com/omeka-s/s/main/page/welcome. 

## 1.5 Chapter summaries

This study consists of fourteen chapters combined into three sections along with a documentary appendix, an appendix describing the ontology of the RDF database, a bibliography, and an index. The first section consists of three chapters. This introductory chapter is followed by the second chapter that describes the creation of late medieval notarial contracts and outlines the types and structures of the contracts used in this study. The third chapter describes the naming patterns and identification of slaveholders and the enslaved in these contracts.

The second section consists of five chapters that explore the networks of slaveholding in the Genoese Mediterranean. The fourth chapter describes and analyzes the social profiles of the men and women who were named as slaveholders in notarial contracts. The lines of inquiry in this chapter are the social categories of slaveholders and how these inform the social topography of slaveholding. The fifth chapter describes and analyses the dynamics of the market economy of slavery. The focus of this chapter shifts from the social to the economic with three lines of inquiry: magnitude over time, nominal price trends, and monetary conditions specified in contracts that structure this market. The sixth chapter considers the role of Genoa as a geospatial node of exchange that provides a crucial point of intersection between the social and commercial networks of Genoese merchants and the commensurate networks of western Mediterranean merchants. The line of inquiry in this chapter is the regional provenance of merchants specified as slaveholders in notarial contracts. The seventh chapter considers the risk economy of slavery and the novel form of life insurance developed for enslaved pregnant women. The lines of inquiry structuring the economic analysis of this chapter are the temporal coverage and premiums with an analysis of the profitability of this form of insurance. The eighth chapter consolidates the results of this section with an analysis of the social networks of slaveholding instantiated by sales, leasing, and insurance contracts. It profiles the political and economic activity of four merchants in the market economy of slavery and illustrates the crucial social ties instantiated and consolidated by these activities.

The third section consists of six chapters that explore the networks of enslavement in the Genoese Mediterranean. The ninth chapter describes and analyzes the demography of enslaved persons named in notarial contracts. The lines of inquiry in this chapter are the ratio of enslaved men to women as well as the age, regional provenance, and geospatial distribution of enslaved persons and how these inform moments in the life cycle of slavery. The tenth chapter explores the social landscape of enslaved persons in the Genoese Mediterranean revealed though a close and contextual reading of notarial contracts. The themes of this chapter are the health of the enslaved, enslaved women and pregnancy, the clothing of the enslaved, the sexual exploitation of enslaved women, and forms of social control. The eleventh chapter considers the exploitation of enslaved persons as household servants. It profiles the elite families who held enslaved persons, describes household service for notarial families, and details the exploitation of enslaved women as wet nurses. The twelfth chapter considers the considers the exploitation of enslaved persons as workshop servants. It examines the participation of artisans in the market economy of slavery and profiles the three most active groups—silk workers, wool workers, and metal workers—to glean insights into the working conditions of enslaved persons in their shops. The thirteenth chapter considers the exploitation of enslaved persons by religious institutions. It profiles the religious men and women named as slaveholders in notarial contracts, considers the role of enslaved persons in monastic institutions, and profiles the Archbishop of Chios and his redemption of the enslaved through existing market mechanisms. The fourteenth chapter explores how enslaved persons obtained freedom in the Genoese Mediterranean. The two lines of inquiry are the granting of freedom and the taking of freedom and this chapter examines the legal and nonlegal means by which this can be accomplished and concludes with an examination of life after manumission and the restricted freedom of the formerly enslaved.

The appendices concluding this study provide transcriptions of ninety-eight notarial documents relating to the market economy of slavery, a specification of the ontology developed for the *Networks of slaveholding and enslavement in the Genoese Mediterranean World (ca. 1348–1528)* online database,[[41\]](#_ftn41) along with a bibliography and index.

The notarial contracts used for this study will provide crucial insights into the socioeconomic networks of slaveholders and the enslaved of the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean. The identification and analysis of slaveholders will illustrate the omnipresence of slavery across the social fabric of late medieval Genoa. It will show how enslaved persons laboured in elite households and artisanal workshops, within the city of Genoa and the villages of the Ligurian countryside, and were held in captivity and exchanged by both men and women. The analysis of these notarial contracts will illustrate how slaveholders developed novel financial instruments to continuously accumulate capital across the entirety of the life cycle of slavery. These instruments were crucial to the consolidation of early capitalism and served to inextricably entwine the historical phenomena of capitalism and slavery. The analysis of the socioeconomic networks of slaveholders and the enslaved will similarly demonstrate the vital role of slavery in the expansion and consolidation of late medieval commercial networks.

The notarial contracts used for this study represented and reflected the voices and ideologies of the slaveholders. The second half of this thesis attempts close reading of these sources to glean insights into the social world of enslaved men and women. It represents a small and very incomplete step in this direction. Additional work is required to strip away the structural logic of the slaveholding enterprise embedded in these sources and uncover the hidden voices of the enslaved in the Genoese Mediterranean. This thesis represents the preliminary foundation for this future work, which I hope will provide the foundation for a more sophisticated analysis.

 [6] Marc Bloch, *Slavery and Serfdom in the Middle Ages: Selected Essays* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), pp. 1–31. Bloch suggested that the demise of European slavery occurred during the eleventh century from the confluence of social and cultural factors that resulted in the precipitous drop in the supply of enslaved persons. The transformation of land use away from small peasant holdings into larger scale feudal holdings (with former peasants working as serfs) coupled with an increasing Christian moral influence that opposed the idea of human enslavement, were largely responsible for this drop in supply. The increased security of the peasant population and an unease in enslaving co-religionists significantly reduced the raiding wars into neighbouring territories that were the primary source enslaved persons. See also Pierre Bonnassié, *From Slavery to Feudalism in South-Western Europe* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), and Guy Bois, *The Transformation of the Year One Thousand: The Village of Lournand from Antiquity to Feudalism* (London: Palgrave, 1992) for arguments along similar lines to Bloch. These studies are focused on late medieval France and have too often been inferred as applying to Europe as a whole.

[[37\]](#_ftnref37) The identification of the regional provenance, ancestry, and occupation was indicated by the notary in most contracts. The determination of social category, that is, whether the individual belonged to the *nobiles*, *mercantes*, or *artefices*, was a somewhat more time-consuming task. The larger *nobiles* families are quite well known and easy to determine from their surnames. The smaller *nobiles* families required more research, with Giovanni Andrea Ascheri, *Notizie storiche intorno alla riunione delle famiglie in alberghi in Genova* (Genova: Tipografia Faziola, 1846) and Angelo Scorza, *Le famiglie nobili genovesi* (Bologna: Forni, 1973) being the central references for this endeavour. The identification of *mercantes* and *artefices* families an even more time consuming and arduous process. The *Notizie storiche* of Ascheri again proved useful, as well as Antonio Cappellini, *Dizionario biografico di Genovesi illustri e notabili* (Genova: Bologna Forni, 1932) and Francesco Grillo, *Origine storica delle località e antichi cognomi della Repubblica di Genova* (Genova: Collegio Calasanzio, 1960). Despite the broad and extensive coverage of these reference works, it was still impossible to definitely assert the social category for about ten percent of the transactors.
