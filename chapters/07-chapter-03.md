# Chapter 3 Methodologies of slavery: slaveholders and the enslaved in Mediterranean commercial networks

The social and economic history of the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean has largely focused on quantitative economic and demographic analyses at the expense of social relations between persons participating in this vast commercial network. Gerald Day noted several decades ago that “very little work has been done to place individuals into their proper social, political, or occupational categories” and that historians have generally studied the historical individuals of the Genoese Mediterranean in a non-rigorous and very general manner.[[1\]](#_ftn1) This approach—which remains prevalent in many North American studies of the region—results in several methodological problems. The misidentification of persons remains all too common: there were often several individuals operating in the market simultaneously who had the same name and their conflation has resulted in many historical inaccuracies.[[2\]](#_ftn2) The incorrect categorization of the social category of individuals also remains problematic for numerous reasons. This was largely the result of an insufficient understanding of the dynamics of late medieval Genoese families, as well as improper categorization based upon the 1528 social reorganization that merged numerous popular families into the Genoese nobility.[[3\]](#_ftn3) The relationships between surnames and places of origin in the Genoese Mediterranean have also been frequently misinterpreted. The Genoese had their own unique naming customs that were often markedly different from those of other Mediterranean locales.[[4\]](#_ftn4)

This methodological chapter will examine the naming of men and women in Genoese notarial contracts. This chapter will begin with an analysis of the naming of slaveholders, beginning with an explication of social categories and the alberghi—the extended family structures—that are crucial to understanding the complex networks of Genoese enslavement. This will be followed by an examination of the naming of enslaved persons and how their geographical and national origins are reflected in the naming patterns.

## 3.1 Slaveholders in notarial contracts

A notarial contract was a legally binding document, and as such, it was of considerable commercial and legal importance. It was imperative that the transactors were described with the necessary precision to allow for their identification with as little ambiguity as possible. They were denoted by their given name and surname, as was generally the case in administrative and diplomatic documents, but these standard identifiers were supplemented with a combination of one or more prefixes indicating patrilineage, occupation, and place of origin. The proper interpretation of these identifiers is crucial for determining the social status of persons involved in networks of enslavement.

### Regional provenance and social categories

The categorization of individuals in the commercial world of Genoese Mediterranean had a two-dimensional aspect: it was based upon regional provenance and as well as social category. The regional provenance of an individual in the notarial contracts of Genoa and the Genoese Mediterranean was denoted by the use of specific terms applied as suffixes to their name: *civis*, *habitator*, *commorans*, and *burgensis*. The suffix *civis* followed by a place name denoted legal citizenship in a political entity, for example, a citizen of Genoa or a citizen of Florence. A person named as a citizen of a Genoese commercial colony was generally someone who was born and resided in the colony and whose family had Genoese origins. The suffix *habitator* followed by a place name denoted a long-term residence within a city by a person who was not a citizen of that place. The suffix *commorans* or *mercator... commorans* following or surrounding a place name denoted a short-term presence in a city—from a few hours to a few weeks—by a person who was not a citizen of that place. The suffix *burgensis* followed by a place name was used exclusively to denote persons in or from Mediterranean colonies under Genoese administration. Mario Buongiorno suggests that the term *burgensis* applied to inhabitants of places like Pera and Caffa who were not of Genoese origin and furthermore, for the most part, the term was applied to persons from the local indigenous population.[[5\]](#_ftn5) Gabriella Airaldi also notes that persons from geographical regions subject to enslavement, such as captives from the lands of the Tatars or Russians, could become *burgenses* of the Black Sea colonies if they were not enslaved and had been residing in the city for at least one year.[[6\]](#_ftn6) This designation would include any formerly enslaved persons who were lucky enough to obtain their freedom. The *burgenses* of Genoese colonies like Caffa and Pera held the same commercial and economic privileges as citizens but did not possess the same political privileges. They could not serve in political office or participate in the administration of the colonies: these roles were left to Genoese citizens and colonial citizens. The following table provides examples of how these designators were applied and concatenated into various forms.

| *habitator Ianue*                       | an inhabitant of Genoa who is not necessarily a citizen   |
| *civis Sibille habitator Ianue*         | a citizen of Seville and inhabitant in Genoa              |
| *civis Mediolanensis Ianue commorans*   | a citizen of Milan temporarily in Genoa                   |

| *civis Peire*                           | a citizen of Pera                                         |

There were three legally recognized social groups in the late medieval Genoese Mediterranean which were combined into two main groups *nobiles* and the *populares*. The *populares* were furthermore demarcated into two legally recognized groups: the *mercantes* and the *artefices*. This structure is illustrated below.

Figure 3: The social structure of Genoese society ca. 1348–1528

The political offices of Genoa and its colonies during this period of this study were required to be composed of one half *nobiles* and one half *populares*, and the constituent comprising the *populares* were required to be one half *mercantes* and one half *artefices*. The *protectores* of the Casa di San Giorgio, for example, were an eight-person committee that administered the finances of the republic and its Mediterranean colonies. The office of the *protectores* (the *Officum protectorum Sancti Georgii*) was comprised of four men from *nobiles* families two men from *mercantes* families, and two men from *artefices* families. The *Officium monete* was a four-person committee that similarly required the same ratio: in this case its membership was comprised of two men from *nobiles* families, one man from a *mercantes* family, and one man from an *artefices* family. It might seem at first glance that Genoa should be considered a popular republic along the lines of Quattrocento Siena or the earlier short lived Florentine popular republics.[[7\]](#_ftn7) Christine Shaw notes that this interpretation, which might be assumed given the regular and guaranteed participation of persons from *populares* in the governing structures of Genoa, ignores the important fact that the trade guilds themselves did not have any statutory role in the political life and decisions of the city.[[8\]](#_ftn8) It should also be kept in mind that this social categorization ignored the large pool of unskilled workers, not to mention enslaved labourers, who did not practice a craft and did not belong to a recognized guild. There was no representation in social and political life for these individuals.

#### The *nobiles* families

The *nobiles* were persons, as the name suggests, who belonged to one of the officially designated noble families. In the period of this study the *nobiles* referred to any family who had an ancestor appointed to the *antianorum* (the council of elders) or who served on the *consiliorum* (the general council of citizens) prior to the dogeship of Simone Boccanegra (1339–45).[[9\]](#_ftn9) The oldest and largest of the Genoese noble families were descendants of the landed nobility and some noble families continued to possess demesnes in the rural areas surrounding Genoa during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.[[10\]](#_ftn10) But this rural activity was a minor enterprise for the Genoese nobility: unlike the nobles of France and northern Europe, the Genoese concentrated their active in the commercial sphere, particularly in Mediterranean commerce and the economies of slavery. The common feudal trope that nobles looked upon commerce as an activity beneath them was not one that applied to late medieval Genoa. The commercial networks of the Genoese Mediterranean were dominated by the nobility and the *populares* fought hard to embed themselves within these networks.[[11\]](#_ftn11) The major noble families are shown below.

 Table 3: Major *nobiles* families in the Genoese Mediterranean, 1348–1528

|            |           |           |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Camilla    | Doria     | Lercari   |
| Cattaneo   | Fieschi   | Lomellini |
| Centurione | Gentile   | Negrone   |
| Cicala     | Grillo    | Pinelli   |
| de Mari    | Grimaldi  | Salvago   |
| de Marini  | Imperiale | Spinola   |
| di Negro   | Interiano | Usodimare |

These families were also major participants in the market economy of slavery and will appear regularly throughout this study.[[12\]](#_ftn12)

#### The *populares* families

The *populares* families were divided into two distinct categories—the mercantes and the *artefices* —as illustrated in Figure 3. The mercantes were recognized by the state as persons who worked—or whose descendants had worked— as merchants or bankers. The merchants of Genoa did not have their own guild—unlike merchants in other Italian communes—but their social designation allowed for their political participation in the structures of governance. The mercantes families were generally larger and more powerful than their *artefices* counterparts, and some mercantes families were furthermore wealthier than many *nobiles* families, with Aldo Agosto referring to them as the “new aristocracy of money.”[[13\]](#_ftn13) In many ways they were like the *popolo grasso* of Florentine historiography and many Genoese historians have used this very term to describe the mercantes.[[14\]](#_ftn14)

The *artefices* were recognized by the state as persons who practiced a craft—or whose descendants had practiced a craft— and were members of a recognized guild. They were allotted the same proportion of participation in the structures of governance, but their political influence was blunted by the fact that the mercantes often sided with the *nobiles*, as their commercial and fiscal interests were generally more aligned. In many ways they were like the *popolo minuto* of Florentine historiography. The mercantes and *artefices* families were also major participants in the market economy of slavery and will appear regularly though out this study.[[15\]](#_ftn15)

### The Genoese alberghi

The merchants of late medieval Genoa were organized into extended family clans called alberghi. The alberghi were the result of multiple families aggregating into a single-family clan. In most cases this entailed the aggregation of smaller families, or branches of smaller families, into larger existing families, after which the aggregated families assumed the surname of the larger family.[[16\]](#_ftn16) The Lomellini family were also a recognized albergo that absorbed some smaller families into their own. In the late fourteenth century, for example, the Ruffo family were absorbed into the Lomellini albergo and assumed the surname.[[17\]](#_ftn17) In the year 1500 the Bonvassalo family were similarly absorbed into the Lomellini and assumed their surname.[[18\]](#_ftn18) The aggregated families would also assume the social category of the albergo. The Ruffo family were a *populares* family that became *nobiles* through this process.

The aggregation of families into existing alberghi was not always a complete aggregation. It was often the case that only a certain branch of the family was admitted into an albergo. In the summer of 1465, for example, Raffaele, Gaspare, Pancrazio, and Giuliano Falamonica were admitted into the Gentile albergo and took the new surname, while the rest of their family retained the Falamonica surname.[[19\]](#_ftn19) The previous surname was often kept alongside the new surname for a brief period. In the spring of 1456, for example, the slaveholder Enrico de Podio sold two enslaved women to the merchant identified as

> Pancrazio Falamonica citizen of Genoa...[[20\]](#_ftn20)

In the spring of 1466, the underwriter Baldassare Lomellini insured a pregnant enslaved woman held by the merchant identified as

> Pancrazio Gentile formerly Falamonica...[[21\]](#_ftn21)

Just one month after this transaction the leather worker Antonio de Canobio sold an enslaved Bulgarian man to the merchant Galcerán Adret, who was from Catalonia, for which the payment was made from an account held at

> the bank of the banker Pancrazio Gentile...[[22\]](#_ftn22)

These contracts illustrate how Pancrazio dropped all mention of his original surname within a year after aggregation into the Gentile albergo. This adoption of new surnames represents another problem in the proper identification of slaveholders in the Genoese Mediterranean. In some cases, the previous surname was indicated for a much longer time. Jacques Heers notes how individuals in the Giustiniani albergo keep their previous surnames alongside their new ones for over a century.[[23\]](#_ftn23) This was probably done for practical purposes and was not necessarily reflective of an affinity to the old surname. The Giustiniani albergo was exceptionally large and there were often several individuals with the same given names who were around the same age, so the former name was a useful means of demarcating them in legal contracts.[[24\]](#_ftn24)

In certain cases, several families joined together in a new albergo and adopted a completely new surname. The de Franchi albergo, for example, was formed in 1392 through the amalgamation of the Figone, Tortorino, de Torre, Vignoso, Luxardo and Pagana families, who subsequently took the de Franchi surname.[[25\]](#_ftn25) These new alberghi could also be dissolved as well as created. The Scipionibus albergo was formed in 1414 though the amalgamation of branches of the Pinelli, Ardimento, Dentuto, Luciano, Embrione, and Cebà families. This new albergo did not last long and had dissolved by the end of 1458, with the amalgamated families assuming their original names.[[26\]](#_ftn26) The majority of alberghi were *nobiles* although some of the largest ones were *mercantes*.

The consolidation and expansion of Genoese alberghi during the late medieval period allowed for these families to increase their overall power and influence by specialization within the albergo. Some branches would focus on political administration, others in banking and finance, others in international commerce, in an attempt to strengthen and expand their socioeconomic networks. The alberghi were formally recognized by the state were one of the central civic institutions of late medieval Genoa.[[27\]](#_ftn27)

The dynamic nature of the alberghi during the period of this study represents some problems for historians unfamiliar with their mechanics. The adoption of new surnames, as well as the reversion back to older surnames, which could often occur during the lifetime of a single individual, makes it difficult for proper identification of persons unless one is familiar with the nature and dates of alberghi consolidations. The historian must also be careful not to interpret fourteenth and fifteenth-century alberghi through the published lists of the 1528 reforms: in the *Liber civilitatis* which amalgamated the existing alberghi into twenty-eight fixed units.[[28\]](#_ftn28) The alberghi in these lists do not correspond to the alberghi as they existed prior to 1528.

## 3.2 Naming Genoese slaveholders

The slaveholders named in Genoese notarial contracts were always denoted with a high degree of precision: this practice was followed rigorously and ensured identification without ambiguity. The naming of slaveholders entailed the recording of their given name, sometime introduced with a prefix, and always followed by a combination of one or more of surname, patrilineage, occupation, and place of origin.

Men and women from most Genoese families had adopted surnames by the fourteenth century and these surnames were almost always recorded for individuals from the three major social categories.[[29\]](#_ftn29) The use of prefixes, however, was generally reserved for persons who were members of noble families or for individuals who served in important political and religious positions, most of whom were also nobles. If the transactor belonged to a *nobiles* albergo, they were sometimes identified by with the prefix *nobilis*, although many of these families were so well known that this designation was often deemed unnecessary. In the summer of 1453, for example, the nobleman Andreolo Doria, the seller and slaveholder of an enslaved Circassian woman named Maria, was identified as

> the *nobilis* Andreolo Doria, citizen of Genoa, son of the deceased Celestino...[[30\]](#_ftn30)

In another example from the winter of 1477, the nobleman Giorgio Grimaldi, the seller and slaveholder of an enslaved Bosnian woman named Caterina, was identified as

> Giorgio Grimaldi, citizen of Genoa, son of the deceased Angelo...[[31\]](#_ftn31)

Important political figures were also denoted with prefixes, many of which were often very elaborate and obsequious in nature, such as the description of “the illustrious and excellent lord Pietro Campofregoso, by the grace of God the doge of Genoa and defender of the people.”[[32\]](#_ftn32) Members of religious orders were frequently identified with similar prefixes, although these were sometimes less obsequious, such as *soror* for nuns and *presbiterus* for priests.[[33\]](#_ftn33)

The inclusion of patrilineage was an important part of naming within notarial contracts. It allowed for clear identification of the transactor, especially those persons from larger noble alberghi which often had many persons with the same given name active in commerce during the same period.[[34\]](#_ftn34) In Genoese notarial acts the name of the father followed the surname of the transactor, and was recorded in the genitive case, and where the father was deceased, his name was preceded by the prefix “quondam.” In certain cases, especially with the larger families, it was necessary to name two generations of patrilineage. Persons who lived in towns within the republic of Genoa, but outside the city proper, as well as foreign merchants who were either living in Genoa temporarily or passing through its port, also had their names supplemented with loconyms. In a contract from the summer of 1453, the merchant Pietro Grillo, who lived in the commune of Voltri and was the son of the deceased Bonifacio, was denoted as:

> Pietro Grillo, from Voltri, son of the deceased Bonifacio Grillo...[[35\]](#_ftn35)

If any of the principals named in a notarial contract were women, they were identified first by their patrilineage and second by their marital association. In a contract from the winter of 1457, for example, the slaveholder Clara Merello was denoted as:

> Clara, the daughter of the deceased Egidio Merello, and wife of the deceased Niccolò de Monelia...[[36\]](#_ftn36)

If the named woman had been married more than once, the names of her previously deceased spouses would also be listed, in the form of “once wife of... and now wife of....” In a leasing contract from the spring of 1469, the slaveholder Selvagia Doria was denoted as:

> Selvagia, daughter of the deceased Cristoforo Doria, and in the first place wife of the deceased Pietro Gentile, and now the wife of Ottone Piola of Savigliano...[[37\]](#_ftn37)

It must be noted that women slaveholders—and women in notarial contracts in general—never assumed the surnames of their husbands as their own family name. The slaveholder Selvagia Doria in the example above would never have been called Selvagia Gentile or Selvagia Piola. In some cases, particularly with more informal documents, the patrilineage might be omitted, but she would always be named in these cases as “Selvagia, wife of Ottone Piola” and never “Selvagia Piola.”[[38\]](#_ftn38) In the autumn of 1447, for example, the widowed Maria de Marini was identified as

> Maria wife of the deceased Pietro Adorno...[[39\]](#_ftn39)

Lorenda Garlati has noted the revival of Roman law in the late Middle Ages served to strengthen the paterfamilias and this is reflected in the privileged grammatical position of patrilineage with respect to marriage for women in these contracts.[[40\]](#_ftn40) This representation of women as a combination of ‘descended from’ and ‘wife of’ also supports the interpretation made by Carla Freccero of ‘woman’ as an economic category for late medieval merchant families.[[41\]](#_ftn41)

The *artefices* families had also adopted surnames by the fourteenth century. These surnames sometimes retained an imprint of earlier loconyms or patronyms, unlike most surnames for *nobiles* and *mercantes* families. A substantial proportion of artisans also resided in the communes and villages outside the Genoese city walls and this residence was often reflected in their naming patterns. The *artefices* were also identified by their profession about fifty percent of the time. In the winter of 1466, for example, the slaveholder Battista de Vulturo, who was a blacksmith from the commune of Voltri, was identified as

> Battista de Vulturo [from Voltri], blacksmith, son of the deceased Pietro...[[42\]](#_ftn42)

The named occupations of the *artefices* in notarial contracts regarding the enslaved cross the spectrum of professional and artisanal work—there are notaries, wool combers, copper workers, cutlers, leather-workers, mercers, among a myriad of others. Table 4 compiles the named occupations of the *artefices* who were attested as slaveholders in notarial contracts enacted from 1348 to 1528 and collates these named occupations into ten occupational categories. These occupational categories are *post hoc* heuristics for the purpose of analysis and not representative of any actual categories mentioned in late medieval Genoese documents.[[43\]](#_ftn43)

While the recording of an occupation was generally reserved for urban artisans and professionals from the *artefices*, some *mercantes* and *nobiles* were also denoted by their profession, especially those men who practiced as medical doctors and lawyers. In the spring of 1457, for example, the slaveholder and medical doctor Battista Bonivento was identified as

> Battista Bonivento, citizen of Genoa and medical doctor, son of the deceased Ottone...[[44\]](#_ftn44)

In these cases, the profession conferred a certain degree of prestige beyond the family name. These individuals, however, were a relatively minor group demographically, representing about five percent of those persons with named professions in notarial contracts relating to the market economy of slavery. The quantity and occupational breadth of the *artefices* attested as slaveholders suggests that the slaving enterprise in Genoa was not the exclusive domain of the nobility and wealthy merchant classes. The market economy of slavery also included a sizable proportion of urban artisans working in manufacturing industries within the urban fabric of Genoa and in villages scattered around the countryside outside of the city. Only impoverished wage labourers and the destitute did not have access to this market, although many of them would have worked alongside the enslaved, often performing the same work, and perhaps even forging bonds of friendship.[[45\]](#_ftn45)

## 3.3 Naming foreign and colonial slaveholders

The port of Genoa was a nexus for Mediterranean commerce and one of the primary nodes of redistribution in the network of Mediterranean slavery. There was a continuous stream of foreign merchant vessels passing through the city, with ships of all sizes arriving and departing on a daily basis, creating the kaleidoscopic commercial rhythms so vividly described by Fernand Braudel.[[46\]](#_ftn46) It is no surprise, therefore, that many of the principals named in notarial contracts were from locales outside the jurisdiction of the republic of Genoa. These persons were identified by their place of origin and often with a qualification that they were temporarily in Genoa on business. In a sales contract from the spring of 1460, for example, the slaveholder and buyer of an enslaved Russian woman named Caterina was denoted as:

> Francisco of Ibiza, citizen and merchant from Valencia, passing through Genoa...[[47\]](#_ftn47)

The names of foreign merchants recorded by Genoese notaries were often awkward and inconsistently recorded phonetic reconstructions of the actual names. Their place of origin, however, was always carefully recorded. This conforms to the observation by Roberto Lopez that recording a concise place of origin for the foreign merchant was more important than an accurate recording their surname or an accurate representation of their given name.[[48\]](#_ftn48) The important part of the previous example was thus the fact that Francisco was from Ibiza and temporarily in Genoa. It might have been the case that he had a surname that was not recorded, but this was of lesser importance than his place of origin in the local commercial space of the port of Genoa. It should also be noted that foreign merchants in Genoa almost always made sure that their contract was extracted; that is, that they were provided with a physical copy of the contract on parchment that would be recognized by notarial authorities in other locales.

## 3.4 Naming young slaveholders

The age of majority in Genoa—that is, the age in which a person could enter into legal and commercial agreements without the consent of their parents—was twenty-five years. If the transactor appeared to be very young, or there was concern by one transacting party about the age of the other, the notary inserted an additional clause that specified that the transactor was indeed old enough to enter into legal and commercial agreements.[[49\]](#_ftn49) The person in question would have had to provide some form of physical evidence to the notary, such as an emancipation (*emancipatio*) contract that freed them from the legal guardianship of their parents and asserted their independent rights *sui iuris*.[[50\]](#_ftn50) In the summer of 1459, for example, the merchant Giorgio Stella entered into a sales contract in which he was recorded as recently emancipated:

> Giorgio Stella, citizen of Genoa, and son of Battista, and declared as emancipated by him [Battista], as declared by the written public instrument in the hand of the notary Giuliano Torre...[[51\]](#_ftn51)

In this case Giorgio had a physical copy of a contract in hand at the time of the sale, enacted at some earlier date by the notary Giuliano Torre, which was presented to and verified by the enacting notary Tommaso Duracino.

Sometimes the youth in question entered into the contract with their mother or father present. In these cases, the parent or parents would declare—both verbally and in writing—in the presence of the notary and the witnesses that the transactor was of the age of majority and was legally permitted to enter into commercial agreements. In the summer of 1471, for example, the slaveholder Borruele Salvago was denoted as being of sufficient age to sell an enslaved Bulgarian woman named Margarita:

> the nobleman Borruele Salvago, citizen of Genoa, son of Benedetto, greater than twenty-five years of age... has sold...[[52\]](#_ftn52)

In this case his father Benedetto Salvago was present at the sale and confirmed that Borruele was old enough to hold and sell Margarita.

## 3.5 Naming procurators and legal representatives

If one or both of the principal parties were unable to be present at the enactment of the contract, then they could be represented by a third party acting as a proxy or procurator. The use of procuration was quite common and could be used for local, regional, and trans-national transactions.[[53\]](#_ftn53) For example, in the summer of 1414 the Genoese citizen and slaveholder Megello Lercari appointed his fellow citizens Galeazzo Lercari and Francesco Cattaneo as procurators to sell an unnamed enslaved woman.[[54\]](#_ftn54) Procuration was more commonly used, however, for commercial transactions conducted from a distance. This was not necessarily a great distance: artisans working in seaside and mountain villages that populated the Ligurian countryside outside the Genoese city walls would often use procurators in contracts relating to enslaved persons. In the winter of 1475, for example, the silk weaver Massimo de Canitia was named as the legal representative for the leather worker Giuliano de Vulturo, an artisan from the commune of Voltri, to act as his procurator in order to sell an enslaved baptized Muslim named Maria, along with her son, to the merchant Gabriel Marco from the city of Valencia:

> Massimo de Canitia, silk-weaver, son of the deceased Tommaso, as procurator and by name of procurator, as declared by Giuliano de Vulturo, leather-worker and son of the deceased Bartolomeo, and by which Giuliano, on behalf of Massimo, so declares to have the power and representation both to the aforementioned and to the other, having been made by the power of the written instrument as recorded by the hand of the notary Ambrogio Garumbero on the twentieth day of May 1471...[[55\]](#_ftn55)

In this case Massimo presented an extracted copy of an earlier contract enacted by the notary Ambrogio Garumbero that confirmed his role as the procurator for the absent Giuliano.

Procuration was also the time-honoured method for long distance transnational and transcultural commerce in the late medieval Mediterranean, and as such it appears in many contracts relating to the exchange of enslaved persons across the entire region. In the winter of 1485, for example, the Catalonian merchant Juan de Circulis was appointed as the general procurator for the slaveholder Simonetto de Belprato. Simonetto was the resident ambassador in Milan from 1482 to 1492 where he represented Ferdinand II of Aragon in Milan. He was also present in Genoa in 1485 to arbitrate over the competing claims of Florence and Genoa to the region of Pietrasanta.[[56\]](#_ftn56) Simonetto obtained the services of Juan de Circulis during this time in Genoa to conduct at least two purchases of enslaved persons. Juan was named as his representative in the purchase of an enslaved baptized Muslim named Linò, and a few months later in the purchase of a family of enslaved persons, consisting of a baptized Muslim boy named Ferrando and his parents, who were named as Maccori and Francesca.[[57\]](#_ftn57) Despite his busy role in the tense diplomatic negotiations between Florence and Genoa, Simonetto still found the time to participate in the market economy of slavery.

## 3.6 Naming enslaved persons

The sociologist Orlando Patterson refers to the re-naming of an enslaved person as one of the central rites in the ritual of enslavement. He warns against reading this phenomenon as merely an act of linguistic convenience for the transactors. It was instead, in his view, “a symbolic act of stripping the person of their former identity” whereby the former name of the enslaved died along with their former self.[[58\]](#_ftn58) In the Genoese Mediterranean this renaming occurred with the initial sale of the recently enslaved man or woman. In 1420 the Venetian pilgrim Emmanuele Piloti described how men and women sold into slavery at the port of Caffa were given the choice to convert to Christianity or remain “pagan.”[[59\]](#_ftn59) If they chose conversion, they were quickly baptized and assigned new names by the priest before being sold to Genoese merchants. Most of these new names were traditional Christian names, although the merchants would have the authority to assign another new name on purchase, which they often did. There was a small pool of preferred names: Steven Epstein notes that just six names accounted for eighty percent of enslaved women in mid fifteenth-century Genoese tax records.[[60\]](#_ftn60) It appears that the names given to the enslaved were, furthermore, not names commonly given to free citizens. The name Maddalena, for example, accounts for thirteen percent of names for enslaved women during the fifteenth century, but there were only three women in the Lomellini *albergo*—out of several hundred individuals—who were given this name in the two centuries between 1300 and 1500.[[61\]](#_ftn61) This tendency towards a small group of preferred names might be indicative that the late medieval Genoese associated these names with enslaved status and, furthermore, the ancestral inheritance of this status. For the segment of enslaved persons unfortunately named with loconyms such as Iarchasia[[62\]](#_ftn62) and Xeni[[63\]](#_ftn63)—names that openly reflected their origins as Circassian captives—this would certainly be the case.

Enslaved persons also were frequently renamed at geospatial nodes of exchange,[[64\]](#_ftn64), so it might be common for an enslaved person to have been assigned several names as they traversed the commercial networks of the Genoese Mediterranean. In the spring of 1417, for example, the slaveholder Leonardo de Oliva sold to Martino Lomellini an enslaved woman who was described as

> an enslaved woman of Leonardo, of the Abkhazan nation, now named Maria...[[65\]](#_ftn65)

The language suggests that the slaveholder Martino Lomellini had renamed Maria at the time of sale.

## 3.7 Signifying the status of enslavement

Enslaved persons in the Roman Empire were denoted with the terms *servus* and *serva*, respectively. The rapid expansion of the Mediterranean economies of slavery during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries resulted replacement of *servus* and *serva* by more the more recent Latin terms of *sclavus* and *sclava*, respectively, to denote enslaved men and women.[[66\]](#_ftn66) These latter terms became the dominant nouns to denote enslaved persons across the Mediterranean region by the opening of the fifteenth century, although the earlier *servus* and *serva* continued to be used on a semi-regular basis.[[67\]](#_ftn67) Charles Verlinden traces the development of the term back to the ninth century where he noted its initial use as an ethnic term to describe persons from the Slavic regions. In the subsequent centuries it was transformed into a legal term used to signify enslavement and became commonplace in the Black Sea region the fourteenth century.[[68\]](#_ftn68) The old and new signifiers were sometimes used together, as in a contract from the autumn of 1511 where an enslaved woman was described with the prefix *quandam servam sive sclavam*.[[69\]](#_ftn69) The earlier Latin terms *ancilla* and *mancipium* seen in many twelfth and thirteenth century Genoese documents for enslaved women and men, respectively, had disappeared from use in legal and commercial documents by the middle of the fourteenth century, although they continued to appear in literary works.

Enslaved persons in notarial contracts of the Genoese Mediterranean were described rather nebulously compared to the precise descriptions of the principals associated in their exploitation. Their description was less concerned with personal identification and more concerned with reflecting their economic value as legal items of property. The enslaved were described by a prefix indicating their legally enslaved status, followed by their assigned name and a combination of regional provenance, age, and the person who was the current designated slaveholder. This was followed by a clause describing the health of the enslaved person, and in many cases, a second clause stating the legal rights held by the slaveholder with respect to the enslaved.

The language in notarial contracts was carefully chosen to reinforce the legal concept of an enslaved person as property. Just as women in notarial contracts were specified in relation to their husbands, the names of the enslaved were specified in relation to their holders. These name constructs were therefore not related to the personhood of the enslaved, that is, their status as sentient humans. Instead, enslaved persons were “named by”—provided with an abstract identity—which was given by and associated with their holder who was *de iure* their legal owner. This is demonstrated by the general formula used in contracts across the Genoese Mediterranean to designate the enslaved. In a contract from the autumn of 1478, for example, the widowed slaveholder Bertina Grimaldi sold an enslaved woman named Margarita, who was denoted as

> an enslaved woman [held by] the aforementioned Bertina, named Margarita...[[70\]](#_ftn70)

The disassociation of name with personhood was given additional force when subsequent clauses of “once... now...” were inserted to reinforce that the enslaved were the object of a series of commercial transactions. In the spring of 1472, for example, in the lease of an enslaved woman named Elena by the slaveholder Battista Cibo in the spring of 1472, we have the denotation

> an enslaved woman, once [held] by Benedetto Salvago, and now [held] by the aforementioned Battista, who is named Elena...[[71\]](#_ftn71)

A final example of the disassociation of name with personhood can be seen in a sales contract from the winter of 1427. In this contract the merchant Gabriele de Buzalla sold two enslaved Circassian boys, whom were both named Giorgino, to the Mallorcan merchant Nicolau de Oliverio. It appears that the diminutive form Giorgino was nothing more than an abstract identity provided to the two enslaved boys by Gabriele.[[72\]](#_ftn72) The name, probably haphazardly given to the two enslaved boys by Nicolau, was thus simply a form of boilerplate text, neither reflective of the original nor the desired names of the enslaved themselves.

## 3.8 The regional provenance of enslaved persons

The regional provenance of enslaved persons was specified in the notarial sources directly after the given name. It was one of the primary dependent variables, along with age, which determined the value attached to the enslaved as commercial objects. The terms used to describe regional provenance could refer to actual political entities, like the Bulgarian Empire, or diffuse geographical entities, like the lands of the Mingrelian peoples. The stated provenance was an exonym in most cases: they were generally not terms used by the enslaved to describe themselves or their own regional identity. The men and women from the Caucasus regions to the east of the Crimean Peninsula, for example, used the term “Adyghe” to describes themselves. The terms “Circassians” and “Zichs” were *post hoc* terms imposed upon them by western merchants who had taken them into slavery.[[73\]](#_ftn73) Juliane Schiel likewise calls into question the accuracy of these categories as anything other than externally imposed geographical markers, noting that the inhabitants of the Golden Horde, for example, never referred to themselves as Tatars.[[74\]](#_ftn74)

The noble households of late medieval Genoa prized the possession of enslaved women from Crimean Peninsula—whom they called Tartars, Circassians, and Russians—to exploit as unpaid household servants and to serve as superficial indicators of wealth. These enslaved women were therefore the objects of most contracts related to enslaved individuals and their exchange commanded the highest prices at the point of sale. It should be noted, however, that there was a remarkably large and diverse group of attested regional provenances, as shown in Table 5.

 Table 5: Regional provenances of enslaved men and women specified in Genoese notarial contracts, 1348–1528

| Regional provenance | Descriptors                                           | Geographical origin             |

| Canary Islander     | de progenie Canariorum                                | Atlantic Africa                 |

| Hungarian           | de progenie Ungarorum                                 | Black Sea                       |
| Iberian Jewish      | de progenie Iudeorum                                  | Iberia                          |
| Mingrelian          | de progenie Mingrellorum                              | Black Sea                       |
| Muslim              | de progenie Maurorum                                  | Mediterranean Africa, Iberia    |
| Russian             | de progenie Rubeorum                                  | Black Sea                       |
| Tatar               | de progenie Tartarorum                                | Black Sea                       |
| Ottoman Turkish     | de progenie Turcorum,<br />de progenie Teuclorum      | Black Sea, Mediterranean Africa |

The denoted provenances of enslaved persons in Genoese notarial contracts were primarily geospatial constructs, and to a lesser extent geopolitical and geocultural constructs. They were not thus particularly indicative of any cultural or linguistic traits. These provenances were, moreover, rather nebulous concepts that revealed the Genoese lack of ethnographic and socio-political knowledge concerning regions beyond western Europe during the late medieval period. The classification of an enslaved person as Tatar, for example, masked their origin within the multilingual conglomeration of late medieval khanates.[[75\]](#_ftn75) The principal parties in many notarial contracts enacted in the Genoese Mediterranean were often unsure of the provenance of the enslaved person whom they held. There are numerous cases where the notary had written *de progenie* (the prefix for regional provenance or ethnicity) and left a blank space afterwards, suggesting that neither party in the transaction were very certain of the regional origins of the enslaved person.[[76\]](#_ftn76)

There were also some cases where the principals could not determine—or could not come to an agreement upon—the regional provenance of an enslaved individual, so the notary recorded two or more feasible options. In the spring of 1457, for example, the merchant Odoardo Reghiccia came to Genoa from the commune of Taggia to sell an enslaved woman named Maria to the merchant Lorenzo Valletaro, with the declaration that she was either “Bulgarian or Russian”[[77\]](#_ftn77) In another example from the winter of 1456, an enslaved Circassian man named Martino was sold by the blacksmith Benedetto de Bargalio to Domingo Albiac, a mercant from Tortosa. In this case Martino was described rather nebulously as “a Circassian or from any other existing nation.”[[78\]](#_ftn78) In other cases where the provenance of an enslaved person was uncertain, the notary sometimes recorded the generic suffix *de progenie servorum* (from the land of the enslaved).[[79\]](#_ftn79) Jacques Heers suggests that historians should interpret this as indicating Tatar provenance, but he provides no compelling evidence to support this suggestion.[[80\]](#_ftn80) In contrast, the assertion of Charles Verlinden that there is nothing in this suffix that indicates regional provenance, either exactly or diffusely, seems to be the more compelling.[[81\]](#_ftn81)

An enslaved man or woman was sometimes able to assert their own provenance to the enacting notary. In the summer of 1476, for example, an enslaved Hungarian woman named Maria was sold by the nobleman Brancaleone Doria to the commercial broker Tommaso Frugone. Maria had personally declared her regional provenance to the notary and present witnesses herself.[[82\]](#_ftn82) The small number of enslaved Jewish men and women that appear in the Genoese records might seem like an exception to this schema of regional provenance. But this small group were part of the exodus that resulted from the Alhambra Decree in 1492 that expelled the Jewish population from Castile and Aragon. The declaration of Jewish provenance in these contracts therefore also had a strongly regional character.[[83\]](#_ftn83)

Figure 4 illustrates the regions of enslavement in the late medieval Black Sea region. The major Genoese colonies are shown, along with the Venetian colonies of Tana and Trebizond, and the city of Constantinople. Caffa represented the centre of the Genoese commercial network in this region and was the primary commercial and administrative node in the Crimean slaving zone.[[84\]](#_ftn84) All commerce conducted in the surrounding colonies, such as Cherson, Chilia, and Soldaia, was centrally controlled from Caffa. Enslaved persons obtained in these secondary colonies were always forced to embark from Caffa.

### Descriptions of colour for enslaved persons

In her seminal study of late medieval Florentine slavery, Iris Origo described how Florentine notaries took care to describe the colour of enslaved persons with descriptors like black, olive-coloured, white, rosy, and greenish.[[85\]](#_ftn85) Christoph Cluse noted similar observations made by Pisan notaries around the year 1400, who used terms such as white, blonde, brown, olive-coloured, black, and semi-black to describe the colour of enslaved women.[[86\]](#_ftn86) Steven Epstein has argued that these late medieval denotations of colour represented the origins of western racism, an ideological system where the language “of color and race reveals that in the Middle Ages there were already clear ways to see colour as a proxy for other information about a person.”[[87\]](#_ftn87) In early Genoese notarial contracts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, an enslaved man or woman was sometimes, but not usually, assigned a colour by the notary. By the late fourteenth century, however, the recording of colour became much less common within the Genoese sources compared to its continuing prevalence in sources from Florence, Pisa, Palermo and Naples. Epstein does not provide an explanation for this trend, although it might be the result on the increasingly single-minded focus on taking enslaved persons from eastern Caucasus by the Genoese after the consolidation of their colonial network. The sources nevertheless show the occasional use of colour as a descriptor during the late fourteenth and first half of the fifteenth century. In a sales contract from the winter of 1376, for example, an enslaved Tatar woman named Anastasia was denoted as follows:

> an enslaved woman named Anastasia, who is Tatar and about twenty-five years of age or so, and olive coloured...[[88\]](#_ftn88)

In another contract enacted a few months later by the same notary, the slaveholder and son of the former doge Simone Boccanegra[[89\]](#_ftn89) sold an enslaved Tatar child named Martino who was denoted as follows:

> an enslaved person named Martino, who is Tatar and about thirteen years of age or so, and white...[[90\]](#_ftn90)

In the second half of the fifteenth century, colour would reemerge as a secondary descriptor for enslaved baptized Muslims. The declaration of Muslim provenance applied to men and women from north Africa as well as the Iberian Peninsula as shown in Table 5. The precipitous decline of the eastern Mediterranean slave trade after the loss of Caffa in 1475 led to dramatic increase in the number of enslaved Muslims appearing in Genoese notarial acts. Some contracts enacted in the later fifteenth century referred to “black” and “white” enslaved baptized Muslims. Domenico Gioffrè argues that the descriptor “black” referred to captives taken from north Africa, while the descriptor “white” Moors referred to captives taken from the Iberian Peninsula.[[91\]](#_ftn91) He suggested, furthermore, that these descriptors were not necessarily indications of physical appearance but were nominal terms to demarcate geographical origin. It should be kept in mind that the majority of enslaved baptized Muslims were not, moreover, further qualified by colour. This denotation of colour for this subset of enslaved Muslims reveals a divergence from earlier denotations of colour for enslaved Tatars. In the winter of 1462, for example, we have the sale of an enslaved baptized Muslim named Giacomino, who was denoted as follows:

> an enslaved man named Giacomino, who is a black Moor, about twenty-two years of age or so...[[92\]](#_ftn92)

In another example, from the autumn of 1474 we have the sale of an enslaved baptized Muslim named Caterina who was denoted as follows:

> an enslaved girl named Caterina, who is a white Moor, about ten years of age or so...[[93\]](#_ftn93)

If Gioffrè is correct, then these examples reveal the emergence of the trend that served to bind colour with regional provenance. In the earlier contracts relating to Tatars, the colour of an enslaved person was recorded as a noun and followed the denotation of the regional provenance and age, suggesting an independence from these qualifiers. In the later contracts relating to enslaved Muslim persons, the colour of an enslaved person was recorded as an adjective that directly modified the noun relating to regional provenance, directly connecting the concepts of colour and regional provenance around the turn of the sixteenth century. It should also be kept in mind that some of the people denoted as enslaved Muslims might not be Muslims at all but enslaved sub-Saharan Africans who practiced various forms of animist religion. Kenneth Baxter Wolf has demonstrated that the category of *progenie Maurorum* was imposed on sub-Saharan pagan Africans by Portuguese merchants in order to bind them together with Iberian and African Muslims and legitimize them as “an enemy to be fought, captured, and sold into slavery.”[[94\]](#_ftn94)

## 3.9 The multiple exchanges of enslaved persons

There was no dedicated physical marketplace for the exchange of the enslaved in Genoa. The sale or leasing of enslaved persons were, for the most part, transactions between single individuals for a single enslaved person. These transactions required initial informal agreements that would concurrently or subsequently be recorded and formalized in the presence of a notary. In most situations the contract would be drafted contemporaneously with the informal agreement and the physical exchange of the enslaved person. An enslaved woman who disembarked at the port of Genoa, for example, might be offered for sale at an impromptu public auction, after which the buyer and seller would locate a nearby notary to formalize the transaction in writing. In other situations, someone seeking to purchase an enslaved man or woman might ask a notary if he were aware of any slaveholders who might be selling their captives and the notary would subsequently bring together the transactors and record the sale.

In certain cases, the informal agreement was enacted at a date that was far removed from the date of the notarial contract. In these less frequent situations, the notary would generally insert a declaration that referred to the earlier transaction. In a contract recorded during the summer of 1453, for example, the slaveholder Andreolo Doria sold an enslaved Circassian woman named Maria to the merchant Andrea Delfino, who was an inhabitant of the commune of Varazze, a port town approximately 40 km west of Genoa. The contract contained a provenance clause that stated

> and it is this enslaved woman which the aforementioned Andreolo had sold and consigned on the fifteenth day of April of the current year to the aforementioned Andrea, even though the instrument follows the transaction...[[95\]](#_ftn95)

In this case, Maria had been handed over to Andrea about four months earlier. This earlier exchange was probably an informal arrangement between the slaveholders Andreolo and Andrea that both agreed to have notarized later. This initial exchange likely occurred at Varazze and with the intent of formalization at a later date when Andrea was present in Genoa. This type of *post hoc* recording of sales transactions was the most common purpose for this provenance clause, although it was sometimes used in other ways. In the autumn of 1457, for example, a merchant from Syracuse named Rinaldo Pasturella sold an enslaved Tatar man named Bastiano to a merchant from Barcelona named Juan Ros. The notary stated that the sale was made with the consent of the Tommasino Campofregoso, a Genoese citizen who had also been appointed as the captain of a fleet of thirteen galleys that same year.[[96\]](#_ftn96) The subsequent clause noted that Bastiano had been taken captive by this fleet off the coast of Mallorca. It also noted that the Tatar captive had been given to Rinaldo on behalf of Tommasino and his crew, likely as a reward for his service.[[97\]](#_ftn97) In this case the purpose of the clause was to emphasize that Bastiano had been a gift from Tommasino and the subsequent sale by Rinaldo to Juan was made with the full knowledge and consent of Tommasino.

The proper identification of slaveholders and the enslaved within notarial contracts is necessary to identify socioeconomic and commercial trends in the market economy of slavery. The misidentification of individuals in the entangled networks that comprise this economy has weakened the historiography on the subject and serves to obscure important historical trends and moments. This chapter illustrated how free and enslaved persons were named in the notarial contracts of late medieval Genoa. This methodological analysis also illuminated many seemingly unrelated issues, such as the position of women in commercial society, the cultural and geographical imprecision of terms used to indicate regional provenance, and the emerging association of colour with enslavement.
