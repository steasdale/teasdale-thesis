# Chapter 2 Sources of slavery: Genoese notaries, notarial contracts and Mediterranean commercial networks

The chapter will begin with a description of the main sources used in this study—notarial contracts housed in the Genoese state archives—along with an overview of the challenges and rewards of using them to reconstruct the socioeconomic history of late medieval slavery. This will be followed by an examination of the role of the notary in public life along with a quick case study of Tommaso Duracino, a mid-fifteenth century Genoese notary who was particularly active in the market economy of slavery. The chapter will conclude with an overview of the types of contracts used in this study and their structural forms.

**2.1  Notaries and notarial contracts**

The socioeconomic contours of the Mediterranean market economy of slavery between 1348 and 1528 can be reconstructed through a careful examination and contextualization of commercial and legal contracts enacted by Genoese notaries. This section will examine the issues around the analysis and contextualization of notarial documents as historical sources and followed by a description of the creation, organization, and scope of the Genoese notarial archives.

**Interpreting notarial contracts**

The socioeconomic prerogatives of the *annales* school of history led many to explore the long-neglected notarial archives of various urban locales for new sources of economic data. The contracts enacted by notaries were one of these sources that provided new explanatory avenues into the late medieval commercial world. Historians were thus able to glean unique insights into the daily lives of merchants, artisans and intellectuals within these locales: insights that were not accessible through traditional literary works or diplomatic archives.[[1\]](#_ftn1) In the new social history of the late twentieth century, notarial contracts were often advanced as providing an unvarnished view into the late medieval social world, providing a so-called ‘view from below’ as the necessary corrective to the “view from the top” provided by literary sources.[[2\]](#_ftn2) These early studies and their enthusiasm regarding notarial sources have been supplemented in recent works, primarily by colonial and literary historians, who have warned against uncritical readings of these contracts. Michael Clanchy notes that while notarial statements are “true in law” they are not necessarily “true in themselves.”[[3\]](#_ftn3) Kathyrn Burns likewise refers to notaries as “truth's alchemists... [whose] truth was recognizable not by its singularity but by its very regularity.... [a] truth by template.” This conceptual divide between legal truth and what actually happened has its parallel in the conceptual divide between literary truth and what actually happened,[[4\]](#_ftn4) and in both cases the notarial documentation often conceals as much as it reveals.[[5\]](#_ftn5) The notary was not the disinterested attester of the mundane but an active participant in the shaping of the historical record.[[6\]](#_ftn6) In many situations the strict structural and linguistic format of legal contracts makes it nearly impossible to determine the events behind the legal truth. But paying careful attention to the slight variations in content from contract to contract—the slight and generally unremarked omissions and inclusions and often overlooked conditional clauses—reveals aspects of the relations between the slaveholders and the enslaved which can offer brief insights into the social world of enslavement hidden by the morass of legal formulae.

This study will address these concerns in the analysis and contextualization of notarial contracts related to slaveholders and the enslaved. The motivations and machinations of the transactors will be partially gleaned through the reconstruction of the socioeconomic relationships between themselves, the enslaved, the enacting notaries, and the political and financial power structures of late medieval Genoa. The close, contextual, careful, and aggregate analysis of the language of the contracts and the identification of its slight and nearly imperceptible variations, along with alteration, omissions, and conditional clauses, will also provide insights into the experiences and social landscape of enslaved persons in the Genoese Mediterranean.

**The Genoese notarial archives**

The state archives in Genoa contain the largest collection of late medieval notarial contracts in the world. These have been largely neglected in the scholarship outside Italy, particularly from the fourteenth century onwards, apart from a small selection of studies.[[7\]](#_ftn7) This ongoing neglect is the result of many factors, most notably the continuing allure of Florence and Venice, locales long seen as the preeminent centres of the so-called Italian Renaissance.[[8\]](#_ftn8) The sheer quantity of the archived contracts after the thirteenth century, the lack of any form of index or detailed guide to the fonds, and the paleographical difficulties associated with the sloppy notarial hand, have also contributed to steering perspective scholars to other locales. The problem of quantity is certainly daunting. There are over one thousand archival units—consisting of registers, *filze*, and *buste**—*for the fifteenth century alone in the state archives.[[9\]](#_ftn9) The number of notarial contracts within each archival unit varies from several hundred to over one thousand. If one estimates an average of five hundred items per archival unit—and this is a conservative estimate—then the historian must consider a dataset of more than half a million notarial contracts for fifteenth century alone.[[10\]](#_ftn10) And the number grows exponentially when entering the sixteenth century. Expanding the range of inquiry to 1528—the end-date of this study—adds at least another quarter million more contracts to the collection. This massive collection of documents recorded the actions of tens of thousands of persons as well as the myriad of relationships connecting them with the places and material objects that comprised the entangled socioeconomic network of Genoa and the Genoese Mediterranean. This apparently insurmountable mass of notarial material was the reason Fernand Braudel and Carlo Cipolla had abandoned a proposed joint study on Genoese commerce in which they had intended on using these sources.[[11\]](#_ftn11) But if the historian approaches the material thoughtfully and selectively, and takes advantage of new digital technologies, and employs careful analytical and critical reading, it is possible to string together some of the elusive narrative threads that illuminate the social world of the enslaved.

**2.2 Notaries in late medieval Genoa**

The emergence of the notarial profession in the eleventh century, in the words of Michael Clanchy, represented an aspect of the shift “from memory to written culture” in the world of commerce, law, and social relations.[[12\]](#_ftn12) This primarily urban occupation developed from the scribal professions of the High Middle Ages. Notaries were scribes in a literal sense, but they were much more than that. They were also educated on the contours of Roman and statutory law and their contracts, which were drawn up in the presence of the principal transactors and witnesses, served as legally binding documents in the late medieval Mediterranean world.[[13\]](#_ftn13) It is therefore often claimed that they served as “guardians of the public trust” as they were responsible for recording and retaining copies of all the contracts they enacted, which retained legal force *ad infinitum*, in case they might be required for future legal and political disputes.[[14\]](#_ftn14) But it is also important to keep in mind that, as mentioned earlier, that notaries were not passive observers of historical and legal events but active shapers of the historical record.[[15\]](#_ftn15)

**The socioeconomic world Genoese notaries**

The notarial profession in the Genoese Mediterranean was primarily comprised of educated members of the urban middle class, that is, *populares* from the *artefices* and *mercantes* families. Individuals from *nobiles* families did not generally enter the profession and there is no evidence of any nobleman who practiced as a notary in fifteenth century Genoa.[[16\]](#_ftn16) The men—and in this era they were all men—of the notarial profession were required to be proficient in Latin and possess a working knowledge of Roman Law and Genoese legal statutes. Like other persons employed in artisanal and professional occupations, notaries had their own professional association—the *Collegium notariorum*—through which they were certified to practice the profession and enact legally binding contracts in the republic of Genoa and its colonies.[[17\]](#_ftn17)

The private practice of late medieval Genoese notaries included the enacting of wills and testaments, dowries, inventories, business partnerships, legal judgments, guild statutes, and commercial transactions. These documents provide valuable insights into the vivid socioeconomic life of the city. Notaries also served as officials for ecclesiastical, commercial, financial, and governmental institutions, often alongside their enacting of private contracts for individuals and families. The attainment of these socially and financially lucrative administrative offices, particularly those associated with the republic of Genoa and the Casa di San Giorgio, was one of the incentives that lured many ambitious and literate young men into the notarial profession.[[18\]](#_ftn18) It has thus has been estimated that approximately one-half of the notarial community was regularly engaged in extra-notarial administrative work in public and private institutions.[[19\]](#_ftn19) Many prominent cultural and intellectual figures had also trained as notaries: the humanist historians Giorgio and Giovanni Stella, Giacomo Bracelli, and Antonio Gallo were all members of the notarial college and practiced the profession to various degrees.[[20\]](#_ftn20) The majority of positions within the Genoese civil service were filled by men trained as notaries by the early fifteenth century. This general trend became codified in law in 1447, when the doge Giano Campofregoso decreed that all administrative positions in the civil service must be filled by notaries invested by the *Collegium notariorum*.[[21\]](#_ftn21) The simultaneous career path of public and private service served to connect the worlds of culture, business, labour, and public administration through the person of the notary.[[22\]](#_ftn22) This mixing of private and personal interests also makes it necessary for the historian to carefully consider the motivations behind the actions of the transactors and why certain notaries might be chosen over others.

**Tommaso Duracino: A Genoese notary**

The contracts enacted by Tommaso Duracino from 1452 until 1498 represent an important source for this study. Tommaso was a prolific public notary, having enacted an average of two contracts per day throughout the entirety of his professional career. He was a member of the educated urban middle class and, like many of his contemporaries, was a second-generation notary from an *artefices* family. There have been no historical studies of his life or the sociopolitical activities of his family. His surname is etymologically similar to “Durachio”, the medieval Latin loconym given to inhabitants from the city of Durrës. This city is located in modern-day Albania, about 200 km south of the city of Dubrovnik, and it was also a central node of exchange for enslaved Albanian men and women. The Duracino surname first appears in this region, the Adriatic, primarily in Venetian documents.[[23\]](#_ftn23) It seems likely that some of the Duracino family emigrated from this region into Genoa during the late fourteenth century. We know that Tommaso was the son of Battista Duracino,[[24\]](#_ftn24) whom Giovanna Petti Balbi suggests also practiced as a notary, although there remain no copies of his contracts in the notarial archives.[[25\]](#_ftn25) Battista served as the podestà of Ovada from 1417 to 1418, which was a commune in Piedmont region under Genoese administration, and he also owned a large castle and land in the area.[[26\]](#_ftn26) This evidence suggests a prolonged residence outside the city proper, which would explain the absence of any of his notarial contracts in the city archives.

Tommaso had been resident in Genoa for several years before entering the notarial profession in the autumn of 1452.[[27\]](#_ftn27) He married Bianca Fatinante, a woman from a prominent *mercantes* family, one which was certainly of a higher social station than his own family.[[28\]](#_ftn28) Tommaso, like many of his notarial contemporaries, also combined his private service with administrative work for the republic. In 1456 he served in the scribal curia of the Casa di San Giorgio, where he was appointed to record deliberations, letters, and matters concerning the commercial and administrative affairs of the Genoese colony of Famagusta.[[29\]](#_ftn29) He was also named to the *Consilium Sancti Georgii* in 1479, a position in which he would be called upon to provide advice to the executive officers of the bank.[[30\]](#_ftn30) The quantity of contracts that Tommaso enacted over the latter half of the fifteenth century, however, suggests that he focused primarily on his private practice.

As a private notary Tommaso had his “table” in the portico of a house owned by the brothers Angelo and Ottobone di Negro and it was here that he enacted most of his contracts. This house was located in the commercial nexus of the Piazza Banchi and was roughly between and equidistant to the Cathedral of San Lorenzo and the Palazzo of San Giorgio.[[31\]](#_ftn31) The bulk of his notarial contracts were enacted at this location, which he also specified on several occasions as close to his own place of residence. Tommaso also enacted numerous contracts in the portico of the Palazzo of San Giorgio during his final decade of activity, perhaps reflecting his importance to this nexus of financial power.[[32\]](#_ftn32) The mobile character of the notarial profession also meant that Tommaso was also able to enact contracts in a variety of locales within the city of Genoa, including the residences of many prominent merchant families. He was, furthermore and most importantly for the purposes of this study, one of several notaries who specialized in drafting contracts related to commerce in enslaved persons and is thus an important person to our study.

Some historians suggest that the absence of contracts related to enslaved persons in the records of some notaries represents an implicit opposition to the enterprise. This may very well be the case, but it is a difficult one to make given the paucity of contemporary sources opposing the market economy of slavery in Genoa. It is more likely that some notaries had a greater reputation as specialists in this endeavor. The abundant appearances by the men and women from the Lomellini family in the contracts of Giuliano Canella, for example, and their dearth of appearances in the contracts of his contemporary Lorenzo Stella did not imply an active aversion to the Lomellini by Stella or *vice versa*. It was more likely the case that the Lomellini saw Giuliano as the man most suitable for them, just as many slaveholders would have seen Tommaso as the man most suitable for their activities.

The ninth contract enacted by the young Tommaso in the winter of 1453—his first year working as a notary—was for the sale of an enslaved Russian woman named Nestasia.[[33\]](#_ftn33) The second to last contract before his retirement, enacted at the twilight of his career some forty five years later from the same table at the same house, was for the sale of a enslaved Turkish woman named Maria.[[34\]](#_ftn34) The long span of his notarial career was not only bookended by activities related to the market economy of slavery, but was also witness to the historical shift in the source of enslaved persons from the Black Sea region to north Africa and the Ottoman Empire. The testament of Tommaso names two daughters: the illegitimate Andreola and the legitimate Susanna.[[35\]](#_ftn35) Additional research is required to determine the biological mother of Andreola.

**2.3 The structure of Genoese notarial contracts**

The rise of private accounting in the fourteenth century resulted in the decline of notarial services for everyday commercial transactions. But notarial contracts continued to be used to record transactions related to high-value luxury items, such as real estate, nautical vessels, and enslaved persons.[[36\]](#_ftn36) The socioeconomic networks of enslaved persons in late medieval Genoa can be partially traced and reconstructed through the careful analysis of legal and commercial contracts of these contracts. The successful reconstruction of these networks thus requires a proper understanding of how these contracts were structured.

**The general tripartite structure**

The content of notarial documentation varied according to the notary, the type of notarial contract, and the conditions in which it was composed, but the structure of the contracts followed the same general form. These contracts can be roughly divided into three sections: a prefatory section called the *protocol*, the main text of the contract called the *corpus*, and a short concluding section called the *eschatocol*.[[37\]](#_ftn37)

The prefatory *protocol* was often quite short, generally a single paragraph in length in most contracts related to the enslaved. The notary recorded the title of the contract, its enumeration in the *filza* or register, the identities of the transactors, and the objects of the contract in the *protocol*.[[38\]](#_ftn38) The identities of any persons serving as proxies were also recorded, along with a specific declaration of the presence or absence of the transactors while the contract was being enacted. Enslaved persons were generally recorded as direct objects in contracts relating to the economies of slavery. The date of the transaction might also be included in this section, although it was more commonly recorded in the concluding *eschatocol*. The protocol also described the primary action of the contract through a verb or series of verbs that connected the two transactors in a relationship: somebody “sells, trades and delivers” something to another, for example, or somebody “leases, hands over and consigns” something to another, and so on. The bulk of the social information was recorded in the *protocol* and therefore a careful reading of this section is crucial to properly identify the people involved.

The middle *corpus* described the terms of the contract, including the legal and commercial obligations of each contractual party, including quantities of money and previously agreed upon conditions. This section was generally several paragraphs in length and was the largest section of the contract, often spanning several sheets or pages. The *corpus* might also contain references to earlier notarial acts related to the contract and it often contained a great quantity of what appear to be generic notarial *formulae*.[[39\]](#_ftn39) The historian John Pryor warns against the superficial reading of these *formulae*, noting that the “reaction of almost all readers of such notarial documents for the first time is disbelief at the complexity of the legal language and an unwillingness to regard it as being of any importance”, a reaction that ignores legal nuances and “the importance and significance of each particular clause, formula, and term.” Many of these *formulae* were so common that the notary often replaced them with a simple “et cetera” in their own copies.[[40\]](#_ftn40) Any additional participants to the contract, or mentions of individuals related to the contract, were also recorded in this section. The bulk of the binding legal and economic information was recorded in the *corpus and* therefore a careful reading of this section is crucial to elucidate the obligations of each party and provide insights into the undeclared motivations of the contractual parties.

The notarial contract concluded with the *eschatocol*, a section that was generally a single paragraph in length. It recorded the place and date of the transaction, often with surprising precision,[[41\]](#_ftn41) and identified the witnesses present, two or more of whom were legally required for contracts related to the market economy of slavery.

**An example: the sale of the enslaved Lucia**

Figure 1 illustrates the first and fourth columns of a four-column contract for the sale of an enslaved woman named Lucia, enacted in the spring of 1459 by Tommaso Duracino. The protocol contains the title “Venditio sclave” and the numeration “237”.[[42\]](#_ftn42) It begins with the phrase “In nomine domini amen” before identifying the transacting parties participating in the contract. The first person specified was the seller, who was the principal transactor and subject of the contract and whose name was always recorded in the nominative case. In this case he was Giorgio Stella, denoted as a citizen of Genoa and son of Battista:

> In the name of the Lord, amen. Giorgio Stella, citizen of Genoa, son of Battista... has sold, both the title of sale, and by the title of sale, and has given and traded and consigned...[[43\]](#_ftn43)

This Giorgio was not only a slaveholder but also the well-known humanist and author of the *Annales Genuenses*.[[44\]](#_ftn44) This statement specifying the identity of the seller was followed by the specification of the buyer, who was the indirect object of the contract—that is, the person who received the enslaved woman—and whose name was always recorded in the dative case. In this case he was the merchant Niccolò Granello, an inhabitant of Bonifacio, a port city in Corsica that was under Genoese dominion, who was the son of the deceased Giovanni Granello:

> to Niccolò Granello, inhabitant of Bonifacio, son of the deceased Giovanni, who is present, stipulating, receiving, and purchasing...[[45\]](#_ftn45)

The assertion that both principal parties were indeed present and publicly participating in the enacting of the contract was followed by the identification of the enslaved person. They were the objects of these sales contracts and therefore their names were recorded in the accusative case. In this case the enslaved person was a Russian woman named Lucia, who was indicated as being approximately seventeen years of age:

> this certain slave of the aforementioned Giorgio, named Lucia, who is Russian and about seventeen years of age or so...[[46\]](#_ftn46)

The *corpus* of the contract in this example spanned three columns, two of which are not shown in Figure 1 for the sake of clarity. It contained several clauses that outlined the legal obligations of the principals identified in the *protocol*, including specific conditions of sale, as well the agreed upon price and forms of payment. The obligations and conditions contained in contracts related to enslaved persons provide crucial glimpses into the social world of the enslaved as well as the unstated motivations of the slaveholders. These will be examined throughout this study.

The concluding *eschatocol* recorded the time and the place of sale. In this case, the sale occurred in the city of Genoa, in the parlour of the residence of the purchaser Niccolò Granello:

> Enacted in Genoa, in the district of Macelli, in the parlour of the house inhabited by the nobleman Niccolò Granello...[[47\]](#_ftn47)

This statement of place was followed by the date of the contract: the day, month, and year, as well as the approximate time of day. In this example:

> in the year of the birth of our Lord 1459... on the day of Friday 28 May, in the middle of the morning...[[48\]](#_ftn48)

The *eschatocol* concluded by naming the witnesses who were present at the time of enactment: 

> with the [following] witnesses, Leonardo de Stracta, apothecary, son of the deceased Stefano, and Luciano de Sera, son of the deceased Giovanni, citizens of Genoa, who were present to this [act] verbally and in writing.[[49\]](#_ftn49)

The witnesses, along with the principal transactors and the notary, attested to their presence verbally through an oath and in writing by allowing the notary to record their names.

**Bearing witness** **in notarial contracts**

The enactment of contracts related to enslaved persons generally required the presence of two witnesses: this was the legal minimum required by law for Genoese notarial contracts. These persons were only named in the *eschatocol* and could be family members of the buyer or seller, friends or associates, other notaries who were working close-by, or just random strangers. The seemingly random nature of witness in these contracts has led some historians to downplay the identification of witnesses as a useful category of analysis. Quentin van Doosselaere has expressed scepticism regarding the use of witnesses as an analytical category by suggesting that it is impossible for historians to determine “socially meaningful witness participation.”[[50\]](#_ftn50) In his analysis of secrecy in thirteenth-century notarial contracts, Steven Epstein similarly describes contracts where the witnesses were often likely to be random participants with no obvious connections to the transactors.[[51\]](#_ftn51) The subsequent work of Kathryn Reyerson has shown, however, that one of the only sources that we have for the presence of commercial brokers is as witnesses to contracts they helped to arrange. This identification is vitally important in an age where the role of procuration and brokerage was increasingly central for conducting long distance trade.[[52\]](#_ftn52) The time required to record and enact notarial contracts also suggests that a larger proportion of witnesses were probably more than just random strangers. It seems unlikely that witnesses with no social ties to any of the transactors would be willing to part with the hour or so of the personal time required to witness the enactment of a contract. It is more probable that, in most cases, the witnesses had some connection to one or more transactors and this connection can be determined through careful historical methods, such as the construction of microbiographies. They may have been commercial brokers, may have been performing a personal favour, may have familial or official connections, or may have been seeking to create new social connections. In late medieval Genoa, bearing witness was an important aspect of the socioeconomic network of enslavement: an act that can be conceptualized as an exchange and accumulation of social capital. This concept will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8.

**2.4 Notarial contracts in space and time**

The place and date of the contract, the witnesses present to the transaction, and the acknowledgment that the parties present at the transaction recognized the document as a legal record was included in the *eschatocol*. This part of the contract is usually examined to determine the date of the contract, and perhaps identify the witnesses, but it also provides an important layer of geospatial and social context.

**The location of enactment**

There was no dedicated physical structure in late medieval Genoa dedicated to the exchange of enslaved persons. This reflects the notion that the word ‘market’ in our term ‘the market economy of slavery’ is an abstract concept which does not refer to an actual physical ‘marketplace.’ Enslaved persons, as items of commerce, were disembarked at the port of Genoa and sold in impromptu sales and auctions that popped up in the Piazza Banchi, Piazza San Lorenzo, and other commercial locales around the city. This phenomenon of an unspecialized and impromptu market follows the pattern seen in other Mediterranean locales, such as Seville, which was also a major node for the Mediterranean economy of slavery and which also did not have a dedicated structure for the sale of enslaved persons.[[53\]](#_ftn53) There are some mentions of what seemed to be dedicated slave marketplaces in Mamluk Egypt, but these references are too brief to strongly assert the existence of a dedicated structures for the exchange of enslaved persons rather than a temporary locations.[[54\]](#_ftn54)

Genoese notaries kept permanent ‘tables’ in the *loggie* of large noble residences that faced the numerous *piazze* in the city of Genoa, particularly in the neighbourhoods close to the port where merchants from various Mediterranean locales met to exchange goods.[[55\]](#_ftn55) These *loggie* were decorated with the arms and emblems of the family that lived in the residence and the notarial tables contained within them served to publicly associate the notary with the family.[[56\]](#_ftn56) The table of Tommaso Duracino, as noted earlier, was in the portico of a house owned by the noble di Negro family.[[57\]](#_ftn57) This house also host to the tables of several other notaries faced the commercial nexus of the Piazza Banchi. Most notarial contracts were enacted at these notarial tables, although they were sometimes enacted in other locations. In her study of fifteenth century notaries in the French city of Cavaillon, Maëlle Ramage illustrated that the alternate location of enactment was often chosen by the primary transactor, especially for clients of high social status or for contracts that required a symbolic space of enactment.[[58\]](#_ftn58) In the case of Tommaso Duracino, these alternate places of enactment included the private homes of buyers and sellers,[[59\]](#_ftn59) or important institutional settings such as the Palazzo di San Giorgio.[[60\]](#_ftn60)

**The date of enactment**

The notarial contracts of late medieval Genoese notaries were remarkably precise when it came to recording the date and time of enactment. The notary began by specifying the year “of the birth of the Lord”[[61\]](#_ftn61) followed by a time measure known as the classical indiction. The classical indiction was an enumerated year that occurred in a repeating fifteen-year cycle and its specification in notarial contracts was a remnant of Roman law.[[62\]](#_ftn62) Genoa was a jurisdiction with a local form of indiction in which each year began on 24 September. The years denoted by the series 1364, 1379, 1394, 1409, and so on represent first indictions in the temporal scope of this study. This rather anachronistic—and not particularly useful, for the purposes of this or any other modern study—form of dating was followed by an indication of the day of the week, the day of the month, the month, and the time of enactment down to the hour. The time was recorded in medieval canonical hours or, less often, in numerical hours.[[63\]](#_ftn63) The date of enactment in its entirety was typically represented in the following manner:

> Enacted... in the year of the birth of the Lord 1459, on the sixth indiction according to the Genoese custom, on the day of Friday the 17th of May, in the hour of *terces* [that is, in the mid-morning][[64\]](#_ftn64)

The detailed identification of time in this example, like the detailed identification of the contracting parties, was an important legal requirement of Genoese commerce and was made with the greatest possible precision.[[65\]](#_ftn65)

**2.5 Two ways of conceptualizing notarial contracts**

The majority of academic studies concerning notarial acts in the late medieval Mediterranean have been approached from the standpoint of either legal history, with its highly linguistic and distinctly non-contextual bent, or economic history, with its focus on quantitative analysis. These studies, despite their undeniable value, have tended to overlook the complex political and social landscape of late medieval notarial occupational practice.

**Notarial contracts as social networks**

The enactment of a notarial contract required that several people come into contact with each other at some specific time and place. These people might have already had strong social connections, or they might have been strangers meeting for the first time. Consider the enactment of a sales contract. This was not just the creation of an abstract contractual arrangement but was also a socio-temporal event that tied together the principals of the contract. These ties could serve to strengthen existing social ties or instantiate new social ties.

The principals in notarial contracts related to enslaved persons could be one or more persons and also have one or more persons representing them. They were joined in space and time by notary himself—who would often be accompanied by an apprentice—and by two or more witnesses. This temporal social cluster of five or more people would then proceed to enact the contract. The principals were declared as “present and stipulating” (*presenti et stipulanti...*), verbally testifying to their identities recorded by the notary and agreeing that the conditions of the contract were upheld.[[66\]](#_ftn66) The witnesses were also declared as physically “present” (*presentibus testibus...*), and they testified to their own identities as well as the fact that the principals agreed to their mutual obligations. The declarations of the transactors and the witnesses were confirmed in writing and verbally as responses to a set of formal questions posed by the notary.[[67\]](#_ftn67) The notary also confirmed that the contract was enacted in his presence at a specific place and time with a strong degree of spatiotemporal precision. These contracts were usually recorded in a specific urban location—like a table located in the room of a specific property—and the time of day was recorded in medieval canonical hours or standard numerical hours. In the midst of this process the notary would scribble highly abbreviated preliminary notes on a loose piece of paper called a *nota*. Once the parties had testified to their identities and agreed to the conditions of the contract, and the witnesses had declared their witness, the notary would then draw up a second document called a *scheda*—entered in the pages of a codex or upon individually folded paper sheets called *filze*—which represented a preliminary version of the contract.[[68\]](#_ftn68) The principals then reviewed the agreement, making changes and additions if necessary, and when everyone was in agreement, the *scheda* would be finalized with the addition of the enaction clause (*actum in...*) at the end of the contract. The notary then used the completed *scheda* to draw up a formal agreement on a large folio called a *grossus*. This was made for the primary transactor: the seller in sales contracts, the slaveholder in leasing contracts, and the underwriter in insurance contracts. The *grossus* was a formal copy of the contract, written in full and with no abbreviations or ellipses, and generally on large pieces of high-quality parchment. The secondary transactors could also request that a *grossus* be created for themselves for an additional fee. The *scheda*, in contrast to the formal *grossus*, was recorded in registers or *filze*, generally written on cheaper cloth paper, made liberal use of abbreviations and ellipses,[[69\]](#_ftn69) and retained the corrections, cancellations, and additions made during the process of enactment. These errata and additions, often overlooked by historians, can also offer insights into the process of negotiation. The *schede* were kept by the notary as part of his professional record until his death, after which they would be deposited at the *Collegium notariorum*. The *scheda* form of notarial act is the one that exists as registers and *filze* in fonds of the notarial archives.[[70\]](#_ftn70) Figure 2 illustrates how a sales contract functions as the central node connecting the various actors and places in this social network.

**Notarial contracts as ritual process**

The formalized and repetitive nature of notarial activity suggests that the historian might also interpret the process of enacting notarial contracts as a form of ritual. In his seminal study of early modern ritual, Edward Muir describes ritual as a “social activity that is repetitive, standardized, a model or a mirror, and [in] its meaning is inherently ambiguous.”[[71\]](#_ftn71) Premodern ritual has typically been considered an activity of the religious sphere, and to a lesser degree, the sphere of government—particularly monarchical government. The enactment of late medieval notarial contracts, however, appears to fulfill the criteria put forth by Muir. There is a repetitive quality to the actions of the participants—particularly with the public and verbal declarations—and this quality is furthermore reflected in the repetitive quality of the notarial language itself. The authoritative import of Roman law and civic statutes, coupled with strictly enforced guild regulations, ensured that the text of notarial acts, as well as the social process of enactment by the participants, were all highly standardized. The use of notaries in the socioeconomic sphere, particularly for sales and partnerships, also serves to emphasize the appropriate model for proper commercial behaviour. And the grounding of late medieval notarial culture in the parallel revivals of the Latin language and Roman law served to add an ambiguous meaning to the social activity of enacting a contract. The majority of the participants in this social act certainly had little to no knowledge of the Latin invoked by the notary and recorded in the *grossus* which they received, and probably even less understanding of the purpose served by the numerous and somewhat repetitive clauses. The meaning of the language, the numerous clauses of the contract, and the highly formalized process was probably difficult to comprehend for the merchant eager to conclude an economic exchange. The notion of the contract, however, as a permanent record that represented legal evidence of a completed transaction was well understood and not disputed by those involved in the sale.

**2.6 Contracts related to Mediterranean slavery**

The ubiquity of the market economy of slavery impacted all aspects of Genoese life. This is illustrated by the regular appearance of enslaved and formerly enslaved persons in a wide array of notarial documents. They are attested in last wills and testaments, inventories, gifts, dowries, augmentations, renunciations, cessions of rights, recognitions and settlements of debts, affidavits, commercial agreements, powers of representation, promissory notes, transportation contracts and many other forms of notarial contact, some of which are summarized in Table 1 below.[[72\]](#_ftn72)

There were also certain contracts, alongside those listed above, that directly concern the socioeconomic world of the enslaved. These are sales contracts, leasing contracts, insurance contracts, and manumission contracts specifically related to the exchange and exploitation of enslaved persons. These contracts are described in the following sections.

**The sales contract for enslaved persons**

The contracts that recorded the sale of enslaved persons in late medieval Genoa were usually titled *venditio* *sclave* or *venditio* *sclavi* (for enslaved women and men, respectively) by the notary.[[73\]](#_ftn73) These contracts were specializations of the classical *emptio-venditio* contract established in Roman law. This classical precedent was a bilateral contract in which the *venditor* (the seller) and the *emptor* (the purchaser) were bound to a series of rights and obligations regarding the *res* (the thing being sold), *merces* (the price), and the *mercantilium* (the means of payment) and which required at least two witnesses.[[74\]](#_ftn74) The late medieval adaptation of Roman contracts for the sales of enslaved persons was not just exclusive to Genoa. Contracts with similar structural forms emerged across the entire Mediterranean during the thirteenth century, in both Christian and Islamic commercial centres.[[75\]](#_ftn75)

The proliferation of these new forms of sales contract was crucial to the market economy of slavery for two reasons. The ancient Romans specified, first of all, that the object of a sales contract—the *res* or thing—could not be a person under law. The fact that they allowed enslaved persons to be objects of sales contracts reflected the fact that they were not considered legal persons in classical society.[[76\]](#_ftn76) The revival of these classical legal and economic mechanisms in the Late Middle Ages thus served to reinforce and augment existing concepts of enslavement based upon captivity and religion and allowed for the proliferation of various forms of legally sanctioned exploitation. They also served to revive the structural foundations of ancient Europe’s most notorious ‘slave society.’ The concept of a ‘slave society’ was defined by classical historian Moses Finley and further elucidated by sociologist Keith Hopkins as a society in which the enslaved “play an important part in production and form a high proportion... of the population.”[[77\]](#_ftn77) It was defined in opposition to a ‘society with slaves’, one in which enslaved persons were held in captivity but were not structurally essential to the socioeconomic operation of that society. Late medieval Genoa was not a ‘slave society’, but the revival and adaptation of Roman law by Genoese merchants to the Mediterranean situation helped lay the structural foundations for the subsequent moral tragedy of the Atlantic slave system. These contracts will be examined in detail throughout Parts II and III of this study.

**The leasing contract for enslaved persons**

The contracts that recorded the leasing of the enslaved in late medieval Genoa were generally titled *locatio* *sclave* or *locatio* *sclavi* (for women and men, respectively), although other forms of nomenclature might be employed. These were based on the classical *locatio*-*conductio*, which was a bilateral contract in which the *locator* (the lender) and the *conductor* (the receiver) were bound to a series of rights and obligations regarding the *res* (the thing being leased). The classical *locatio*-*conductio* contract, after naming the lender, receiver, and the thing being leased, also had to specify the *merces* (the price), the means of payment, and the term of the lease.[[78\]](#_ftn78) This contract was essentially a specialization or extension of the classical *emptio*-*venditio* contract discussed in the previous section, and as such, it was contracted in the form of a sale with the addition of its validity for a specified period of time.[[79\]](#_ftn79) Further specializations were developed from this contract in classical Roman law for the leasing the labour of men and women: the *locatio* *operarum* for free persons and the *locatio* *servi* for enslaved persons. In these cases the *res* of the contract was not the legal ownership over the person—the lender retained dominion over the enslaved person and the free person retained their own dominion—but the *potestas*, the power to compel through command the labour of the person, was the *res* that was given to the receiver.[[80\]](#_ftn80) In the Genoese *locatio* *sclave* contracts, which were late medieval revivals of the classical *locatio* *servi* contract, the lender thus transferred their legal right of command over the enslaved man or woman, but not their right of legal ownership. These contracts will be examined in detail and in tandem with sales contracts throughout Parts II and III.

**Insurance contracts for enslaved women**

The study of commercial and socioeconomic networks of slavery in the medieval and early modern Mediterranean has primarily focused on sales contracts, commercial partnership agreements, and private account books.[[81\]](#_ftn81) Insurance contracts against the risk of death from childbirth for pregnant enslaved women also represent an additional important source for elucidating these complex networks and can provide a wealth of information on the socioeconomic life of slaveholders and the enslaved within Mediterranean cities and their larger socio-political structures. These contracts are, furthermore, often the only extant evidence for a wide variety of commercial and social activity due to the fragmentary nature of sources from this period. Insurance contracts relating to the enslaved can thus provide valuable information on the social fabric of free and unfree persons within the city of Genoa. They are often the only source available that attests to the existence of many enslaved persons or definitively demonstrates that certain individuals held enslaved persons. The notarial acts that recorded life insurance on enslaved women in fifteenth century Genoa were generally—but not always—titled *asecuratio sclave* by the notary.[[82\]](#_ftn82)

These insurance contracts followed a more rigid structure and were much more concise than the sales and leasing contracts discussed above. The variations from notary to notary were thus generally very slight compared to other forms of notarial contracts. The contract began with the identification of the persons underwriting and purchasing the insurance. The identification of the enslaved woman appeared in the *corpus*, along with the conditions of the insurance contract, including the length of the coverage and the obligations of the transactors. This section was usually two to three paragraphs in length and much shorter than the *corpus* of the sales and leasing contracts. The insurance premium, furthermore, was never specified in the *corpus* nor in any other part of the contract. This was a notarial convention that allowed the transactors to avoid suspicions of usury. These contracts will be examined in greater detail in Chapter 7.

**Manumission contracts for enslaved persons**

The contracts that recorded the manumission of the enslaved were generally titled *franchixia*, or some variation thereof, by the notary.[[83\]](#_ftn83) The late medieval manumission contract was a specialization of the classical *manumissio* contract from Roman jurisprudence. It was structured as a bilateral contract in which the *proprietarius* (the slaveholder) gives a *beneficium* (the grant or gift of manumission) to the *servus* or *serva* (the enslaved man or woman). The gift of manumission was represented by the legal change of social status from *res* (a thing) into *homo* *sui iuris* (a person by law) along with the transfer of an accompanying set of legal rights and privileges. This transaction between the slaveholder and the enslaved was followed by a series of clauses that outlined the obligations of the slaveholder and the formerly enslaved man or woman. The provenance of classical Roman jurisprudence was reflected in the language employed by the notaries. In many documents the manumission was explicitly conducted “according to the practice and customs of the Roman state.”[[84\]](#_ftn84) The formerly enslaved individual was also often indicated as having obtained the rights of a Roman citizen and was now person by law.[[85\]](#_ftn85)

The enactment of a manumission contract was a legal procedure as well as a social act, in much the same manner as the other forms of contracts regarding the enslaved. The presence and role of the additional family members in certain manumissions imparted a highly ritual character upon them and served to symbolically welcome the formerly enslaved person as a *familiaris* of the household. The term *familiaris* denoted a person who was considered a member of the household but who was not a blood relative: a social category that was codified into law in medieval Genoa.[[86\]](#_ftn86) Manumissions were sometimes incorporated into sales or leasing contracts with the declared manumission occurring a specific period of time after the sale or at the end of the term of lease.[[87\]](#_ftn87) Many other manumissions were enacted as simple *promissio* (promissory notes) contracts: there are most certainly many undiscovered manumissions in the archives recorded in this manner.[[88\]](#_ftn88) These contracts will be examined in detail in Chapter 14.

Notarial contracts can offer unique windows into the social fabric of the late medieval Mediterranean. The careful, contextual, and aggregate reading of these documents allows the historian to consider the legal truth as well as look past the legal truth and obtain impressions of the social world left out of these contracts. Notarial contracts are not just artifacts of desiccated accountancy:[[89\]](#_ftn89) considered within the larger socioeconomic networks of the late medieval Mediterranean they represented crucial nodes that served to connect a variety of social actors into socioeconomic networks. This study will make extensive use of notarial documentation to document the world of slaveholders and commercial networks of enslavement, as well as the socioeconomic world of the enslaved, in the Genoese colonies of the late medieval Mediterranean world. It should be kept in mind that these notarial contracts were written from the perspective of the slaveholders and reflected their voices and attitudes towards enslavement. Part III of this thesis represents an attempt towards the analysis of the actions, motivations, and perspectives of the enslaved. It is a preliminary attempt that will require further archival and secondary research to fully uncover the voices of the enslaved.

[[7\]](#_ftnref7) Almost all English language scholarship using notarial sources from Genoa has focused on contracts enacted in the two centuries prior to the Black Death. The scope and breadth of Genoese medieval notarial sources from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is unmatched, and as such, these sources have garnered the greatest degree of attention from non-Italian scholars. The central historical studies that have considered these sources in a significant way are Eugene Byrne, *Genoese Shipping in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries* (Cambridge: The Medieval Academy of America, 1930); Robert Reynolds, *The Market for Northern Textiles in Genoa, 1179–1200* (Bruxelles: La Revue, 1929); Gerald Day, *Genoa’s Response to Byzantium, 1155–1204: Commercial Expansion and Factionalism in a Medieval City* (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988); Steven Epstein, *Wills and Wealth in Medieval Genoa, 1150–1250* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984).

Registers contain contracts that were recorded and bound in a traditional book form; *filze* collect loose contracts of identical size which are sorted and tied together with a string; buste are folders, envelopes, or small boxes containing loose contracts of various sizes.

[[10\]](#_ftnref10) The number is even more impressive when one considers how much has been lost. Only a small set of *filze* and registers exist from the numerous notaries stationed in the Genoese Mediterranean colonies. Many chronicles refer to attacks on or the destruction of Genoese colonial *fondachi* which would have housed these documents. The bombardment of Genoa in 1684 by Louis XIV of France also destroyed significant parts of the notarial archive. This absence is regularly seen in the existing notarial contracts. It is quite common to come across documents that refer to previously enacted contracts that do not exist in the archive.

Some notaries also created rudimentary indices by recording these titles in a *rubrical*, which was inserted as a few sheets the end of the filza or recorded on the final pages of a register. These *rubrice* were usually sequential lists of notarial acts. They almost always recorded the title or the type of each contract. In certain cases, the notaries also took care to record the principal transactors and date of the act. Notaries created these *rubrice* to allow themselves to access previously enacted contracts in a quick and easy manner.

[[40\]](#_ftnref40) The archived contracts, as noted earlier, were the summary copies made for the notary’s personal record based on the grossus issued for one or more of the transactors. The copies created for the buyer and seller were most certainly written out in full. The classic lament against these summary practices, from the view of the modern historian, is Auguste Dumas, “Dieu nous garde de l’et cetera du notaire,” in *Mélanges Paul Fournier*, ed. Gabriel Le Bras (Paris: Recueil Sirey, 1929), pp. 153–69.

[[41\]](#_ftnref41) The notary generally included the time of day following the date of the transaction. The place of transaction usually indicated the property where the contract was enacted, and sometimes even the room or section of the property where the transaction occurred.

[[42\]](#_ftnref42) Some notaries, such as Giovanni Danove (active 1452–1503), numbered their acts as they recorded them, while the enumeration of many others late medieval notarial acts was made by eighteenth century archivists. Many of these later numbered contracts were not properly numbered in chronological sequence, and as such, a project of re-sequencing (and correspondingly, renumbering) these acts was begun in 2001 by the archivist Alfonso Assini. See Dino Puncuh, “I cartolari notarili genovesi: un patrimonio culturale eccezionale,” in *Omaggio a Fausto Amalberti* (Genova: Società ligure di storia patria, 2016), pp. 292–6. This result of this still ongoing project has resulted in some documents having two, or even sometimes three, enumerations. In the example of this contract by Tommaso Duracino, the enumeration was clearly not in his hand and was most likely an eighteenth-century inclusion.

[[81\]](#_ftnref81) The Genoese historian Luigi Tria, for example, pretty much ignored insurance contracts in his study of slavery in Genoa from the tenth to sixteenth century. See his *La schiavitù in Liguria* (Genova: Società ligure di storia patria, 1947), pp. 132–3 for a very brief mention of these contractual arrangements during his discussion on pregnant enslaved women. The study of insurance and slavery in the late medieval Mediterranean has traditionally focused on insurance against the risk of flight. Studies that have dealt with life insurance for enslaved persons include José María Madurell Marimón̦, “Los seguros de vida de esclavos en Barcelona (1453–1523): documentos para su estudio,” *Anuario de historia del derecho español* 25 (1955), pp. 123–88 and Geoffrey Clark, “Slave Insurance in Late Medieval Catalonia,” in *Sicherheit in Der Frühen Neuzeit: Norm, Praxis, Repräsentation*, ed.

The term was adopted by Genoese doges to describe the network of extended family contacts other dependent individuals, and by the fifteenth century Genoese and north Italian nobles included the enslaved, free servants and other dependents within its semantic umbrella.
